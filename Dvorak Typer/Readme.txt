Dvorak Typer;
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dvorak_keyboard_layout

This keyboard layout was designed as an alternative to the QWERTY keyboard layout.
It is not as popular than the qwerty keyboard layout but it is more efficient and logical than the QWERTY keyboard layout.
The orthographic variant I created is more suited for everyday typing of a language.
