Keyboard Layouts — Help Documentation; 

These are the computer programs that I make using a keyboard layout editor program.
These programs basically re-arrange the letters on the keyboard with other letters.

They are particularly useful in creating computer programs for typing in other languages and alphabets.

The way my keyboard layouts work is that I try to assign the letters found in other alphabets to where they would be on the keyboard.

For example, in the Arabic Typer, the letter 'ل' (lām) is located at the same key where the letter 'L' is.
In the Cyrillic typer, it is located at the same position, except we get the letter 'л'.

This is a necessary step in facilitating typing well and typing fast and without errors accross different writing systems.
This allows us to type different alphabets and languages from a retained muscle memory.

I make a separate computer program for every separate block as defined in Unicode.

For example, Russian and Serbian may both be written in Cyrillic. But I do not make separate programs for each.
Instead, I make one computer program that writes Cyrillic as best as I can.

Then, of course, it does not cover all of the letters and letter variants used in writing Serbian.
To address this issue, I develop IMEs, which when we type for example the letter 'і' and hit TAB, we see a menu which gives us 'ј'.

The idea here is that I do not make only keyboard layout programs but also other programs that work in tandem with these programs
in order to give the typist the best typing experience.
