QWERTY Ethiopic (Ge'ez Script) Keyboard Layout;

There is a perfect letter-to-letter ratio here because the Ethiopian writing system also has twenty-six letters.
However, it has some variant letters with a bar going on top of the letters.
Those letters are typed by pressing the shift key.
For some letters, there are also caps lock and capslock+shift variants.
For example: ጠ, ꬠ, ጨ, ⶸ. base letter, shifted letter, capslock letter, capslock+shift letter.
I intentionally put all the letters containing this particular mark ꬠ at shift positions, so that is how they are typed.

Fully supports the following Unicode blocks:
Ethiopic 1200-137F
Ethiopic Extended 2D80-2DDF
Ethiopic Extended-A AB00-AB2F

Does not support the following Unicode blocks:
Ethiopic Extended-B 1E7E0-1E7FF
Ethiopic Supplement 1380-139F

The program does not include the Ethiopic tonal marks, however it does include all of the punctuation marks.
Switch between the Ethiopic and the Latin alphabet punctuation marks such as the colon and the semicolon by pressing the scroll lock key.

Types in the left to right direction.
That is the correct modern direction of the letters.
Does not supprot the historical right-to-left typing of letters.
This feature may be implemented at a later date.

The spaced version types a slightly wider space due to the wider width of the letters.
Furthermore, words can be separated by using ctrl+space with the Ethiopic word space character (፡).

This program itself is not enough to type in Ethiopian languages due to many letter variants (over 400 letters).
An IME has to be used.
Run the IME program (hotstrings.exe) and load the "IME Ethiopic.csv" library.
After typing the letter, press the (Tab) key to trigger the selection menu.
Then select the letter that is desired from the menu that appears.

For example, type (በ) by pressing the (b) key, then hit the (Tab) key on the keyboard.
A menu will appear showing letter variants such as (በ¦ቡ¦ቢ¦ባ¦ቤ¦ብ¦ቦ¦ቧ¦ᎄ¦ᎅ).
Select the letter that you want to type from there.
There should also be keyboard navigation and selection of letters, but it may be buggy and it may not be working properly.
Any selection will work however when selected with a mouseclick.
Upon selecting the letter, the program will delete what you typed (በ) and replace it with the selection (ቧ).

How to type Ethiopic numbers correctly on the computer?
Typically Ethiopic numbers have lines that go on top and below the digits.
The lines are correctly supposed to connect above and below the digits continuously.
However, although the top line connects without problems, in certain cases there are graphical glitches for the line below the numbers.
One way around this problem to ensure that numbers display correctly is to use the zero-width-no-break space (U+FEFF).
This however also has the downside of cutting the continuous line into segments, but at least the graphical glitch is avoided.

The Ethiopian digits are located on the top row number keys.
To type regular digits, use the numpad.
