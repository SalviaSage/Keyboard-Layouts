A keyboard layout for typing in the Arabic and Persian languages.
The aim of this keyboard is that not only that it would support Arabic and Quranic Arabic but that it
would also support Persian and Dari.

It does not support, however, Urdu, Shahmukhi or Pashto.

VOWELS:
There is only one vowel letter in the Arabic script and that is the first letter of the alphabet, alef.
To type it, press the letter 'a' on the keyboard. Otherwise, there are three diacritics that show vowels.
These are the fathah, kasrah and dammah. Fathah is located at the 'e' key, kasrah at 'i' and dammah at 'u'.

To type the tanween, that is, the fathatin, kasratain and dammatain, again, you press the same vowel keys
but while pressing the shift key.So, shift+e for fathatain, shift+i for kasratain, shift+u for dammatain.

Furthermore, the vowel [u] and [i] can be spelled with the letters waw and ya in Arabic, which are also consonant letters.
Long vowels are written using a combination of the harakah vowels and the letters alef, waw and ya.
So, first we type the harakah followed by its consonantal counterpart.
To make typing long vowels easier, I made it so that you can press shift + alef, waw or ya keys to type both the harakah and the letter.

To type the sukoon, press the 'o' key on the keyboard.
To type the shaddah, press shift+spacebar or caps + o key.

It may be that you want to type the letters in an unjoined fashion.
For that you need another keyboard layout program as by default, the letters connect to each other.

To do that, install the other .exe file titled IsolatedLetters.exe
