Technically, this alphabet is a semitic alphabet that is related to the Arabic script.
It is also typed right-to-left like the Arabic script.
However, the script also has some similarities with Indic scripts.

The numbers have to be typed either as regular numbers as 0123456789 or sometimes with Arabic numbers as ۰۱۲۳۴۵۶۷۸۹.
