Thaana (Dhivehi) Typer;

You should use the toggleable caps lock script, found here for better typing:
https://github.com/SalviaSage/Autohotkey-Scripts-Repository/tree/master/Holdable%20Caps%20Lock

The scroll lock has been given a new job which I call the "Kana Lock".
Press the scroll lock to type in the Latin alphabet, press it again to type in the target alphabet.
This gives us a way to type in different scripts from the same keyboard layout without switching keyboard layouts.
This state is saved and does not reset when switching between keyboard input methods.

The alternate versions use the Arabic comma, semicolon and full stop instead of reverse comma, reverse semicolon and fullstop.
