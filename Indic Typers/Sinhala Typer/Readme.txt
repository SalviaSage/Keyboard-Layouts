You should use the toggleable caps lock script, found here for better typing:
https://github.com/SalviaSage/Autohotkey-Scripts-Repository/tree/master/Holdable%20Caps%20Lock

-----

The scroll lock has been given a new job which I call the "Kana Lock".
Press the scroll lock to type in the Latin alphabet, press it again to type in the target alphabet.
This gives us a way to type in different scripts from the same keyboard layout without switching keyboard layouts.
This state is saved and does not reset when switching between keyboard input methods.
