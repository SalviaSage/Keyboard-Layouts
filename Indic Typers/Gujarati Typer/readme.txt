Gujarati Typer;

You should use the toggleable caps lock script, found here for better typing:
https://github.com/SalviaSage/Autohotkey-Scripts-Repository/tree/master/Typing%20Scripts/Holdable%20CapsLock

Also, you should have the Hotstrings.exe running in the background with my custom library loaded and enabled there.
This library helps correct and automate some vowel maatra mistakes and replace the maatras with independent vowels at the start of words:
https://github.com/SalviaSage/Custom-Libraries/blob/main/Character%20Replacers/Indic/Gujarati%20Vowel%20Helper.csv

The base keys have consonant letters and the maatra (combining forms) of the vowels.
If you hit shift + vowel key you get long maatra forms.
If you want the independent forms of the vowels, then hit the caps lock + vowel key.
Similarly, hit caps lock + shift + vowel key to get independent long vowels.

You have to remember to press caps lock each time a word starts with a vowel unless you have the hotstrings.exe program running in the background with my 'Gujarati Vowel Helper' library loaded and running.
What it does is that it automatically detects maatras at the start of words or after other vowels and appropriately replaces the maatras with the independent vowels.
It is working surprisingly well, which bodes well for us. Otherwise it is difficult to type Indic scripts as the user will have to manually pick between maatras and vowels.

The aspirated consonants are accessed by pressing the caps lock key where their unaspirated counterparts are.

The viraam key serves a special purpose, typed by pressing shift+spacebar.
It is used to construct "conjunct consonants" which is an important part of Gujarati.
It then disappears and instead gives us the conjunct consonant.
To type the viraam without getting conjunct consonants, press ctrl+spacebar instead.
You can also type the conjunct forms of the letters individually by pressing ctrl+shift+spacebar.

The "Zero-Width Joiner" is located at key '{' key.
The "Zero-Width Non Joiner" is located at key '}' key.
They are supposed to help with the conjunct characters.

The Rupee sign can be typed with right alt + r key or the right alt + = key. 

The "danda" and the "double danda" are at the '\' key on top of the enter key.
They serve the same function as the full stop in the Latin alphabet and should preferably be used instead of the Latin full stop.

By default, the numbers are typed from the numpad as ૦૧૨૩૪૫૬૭૮૯.
Press RightAlt+NumKey to type as 0123456789.

How to type the reph?
https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/reph
The reph / raphar (ર્ક) is produced in Unicode by the sequence [ra ર ] + [virāma ્] + consonant.
It can be typed with the Ctrl+Shift+R key.

I am very proud as to where I was able to bring this program.
It has opened the doors for developing programs for typing in other Indic scripts.
