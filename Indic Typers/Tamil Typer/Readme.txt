Tamil Typer. All in all this alphabet isn't even a good alphabet and a lot of things here don't even make sense in my opinion.
For one, it lacks the voiced plosive letters which Tamil clearly has.
For that reason, I placed other letters where the voiced plosive letters are on the QWERTY keyboard.


You should use the toggleable caps lock script, found here for better typing.

The base keys have the consonants and the maatra (combining diacritic) forms of the vowels.
If you hit the shift key + vowel key you get long maatra vowels instead.
If you want the independent forms of the vowels, then hit the Caps lock key + vowel key.
And similarly, hit caps lock + shift + vowel key to get independent long vowels.

You will have to remember to press caps lock each time a word starts with a vowel.

The retroflex consonants are accessed by pressing the shift/caps lock key where their dental / alveolar counterparts are.

The "Q" key is the "viram" and the shift+Q key is the "anusvar".

The Rupee sign is also where the dollar sign is...
 Also if you hit caps lock + 6 you get "Rs" which is rupees in letters.

You can also type the Tamil digits by pressing caps lock + number key on the keyboard, but not on the numpad!


The 'w' key is the "viraam" key and it is also used to make conjunct consonants.
The "Zero-Width Joiner" is at the shift+f position. It is supposed to help with the conjunct characters, but the viraam seems to do the job just fine most of the time.
Access those by hitting the shift+F

The "danda" and the "double danda" are at the period key. They serve the same function as the period in the Latin alphabet.
