Version 8: 2022-01-10

I created this alphabet, after having created the same kind of thing for Greek.
It is an easy way to type Devanagari, and does not require retraining your muscle memory.

You should use the toggleable caps lock script, found here for better typing.

Devanagari Typer, based on the Latin QWERTY layout. Easy to use.

The base keys have the consonants and the maatra (combining diacritic) forms of the vowels.
If you hit the shift key + vowel key you get long maatra vowels instead.
If you want the independent forms of the vowels, then hit the Caps lock key + vowel key.
And similarly, hit caps lock + shift + vowel key to get independent long vowels.

You will have to remember to press caps lock each time a word starts with a vowel.

The retroflex consonants are accessed by pressing the shift key where their dental / alveolar counterparts are.
The aspirated consonants are accessed by pressing the caps lock key where their unaspirated counterparts are.

The "Q" key is the "anusvaar" and the shift+Q key is the "candrabindu".
The caps lock key is the "nuqta", adds a single dot below the letter while the "anusvaar" adds a single dot above the letter.

The nuqta forms of the letters are also already there though, so you may not need to use this key.

The Rupee sign is also where the dollar sign is.. Also if you hit caps lock + 6 you get "Rs" which is rupees in letters.

You can also type the Devanagari digits by pressing caps lock + number key on the keyboard, but not on the numpad!

This is because the numpad now houses some common conjunct consonants, they can be hard to type, so I put them there for single key typing.
The numbers can only be typed on the top part of the keyboard and not at numpad.

The 'w' key is the "viraam" key and it is also used to make conjunct consonants.
The "Zero-Width Joiner" is also here. It is supposed to help with the conjunct characters, but the viraam seems to do the job just fine most of the time.
Access those by hitting the shift+F, also caps, shift+caps+F.

The "danda" and the "double danda" are at the period key. They serve the same function as the period in the Latin alphabet.

It also has the implosive Sindhi language letters with the line under some of the letters as well.

Doesn't really have all of the Vedic extensions except for the stress symbols like the svarita, udatta and the anudatta which I thought was imporant.
