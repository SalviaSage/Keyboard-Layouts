Gurmukhi Typer;

Based on the Devanagari typer.
It is more simple than the Devanagari typer due to much less or no conjunct consonants
and slightly lower letter count.

This letter 'ਐ' is supposed to correspond to the Devanagari letter 'ऐ'.
However, there is a slight divergence here with the use of the above diacritics in comparison with Devanagari.
'ੲੈ' could be used there instead of 'ਐ' as that corresponds with Devanagari better.
I included this character on the shift+tab key.
Similarly, 'ਅੋ' key is on the ctrl+tab key. That can be used instead of the default 'ਓ' letter.

Shift+z gives us 'ਜ਼਼' which isn't actually letter in Gurmukhi, but it is supposed to represent the 'w' sound.
Similarly, shift+v gives us 'ਵ਼' which is the correct way to write the letter/sound "w".

These two addition letters are important for typing some sounds that Gurmukhi does not traditionally support.
It is in fact a mistake to spell Punjabi with the letter 'w', the letter 'ਵ' corresponds to the Latin letter 'v', same with Devanagari 'व'.

No equivalent of the letter 'ष' in Gurmuhki, but 'ਸ਼਼' can be used for this purpose instead.
No equivalent of 'ॹ' or 'झ़' in Gurmuhki, but again, I created the letter 'ਜ਼਼' for this impportant sound found in other languages ( ʒ ).
