I wanted to make the Gurmukhi typer after I made the Devanagari typer.
The number of Gurmukhi unicode characters are less than the Devanagari letters.

So, the keyboard has more or less full representation of all of the Gurmukhi characters.

There are few differences between the two keyboards.

One difference is that the Gurmukhi alphabet does not have the (à¤¶ ) letter.
That letter is where the "w" key is, in the Devanagari keyboard layout.

However, it has two unique independent vowel forms called "ura" and "iri".

And so, I put those vowel letters where the key "w" is.
"ura" is the base key and the "iri" is the shift+base key.

Other than that, there are few differences between the two that is not noteworthy.

Have fun typing.
