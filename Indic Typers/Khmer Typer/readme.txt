Khmer Typer;

A particularly difficult script developed based on the Devanagari script.

In this script, every letter can be written as a small-form (subscript) letter under other letters.
This computer program gives full support for that.
To type letters this way, you hold down the right alt key, and type press any of the letter keys once.
When you let go of pressing right alt, you go back to typing normally.
Another way to do this is to press ctrl + space, let go and then press any of the letter keys once.

"Khmer a-series consonants" come first, while the "Khmer o-series consonants" come second.
Aspirated variants go on caps lock keys like in the program for Devanagari.
"Khmer a-series consonants"
"Khmer o-series consonants"

- This script has its own colon character which can be typed by pressing caps lock + semicolon key.
Otherwise it will type the regular semicolon and colon.

- The top row number keys exclusively have diacritics and some vowel markers.

- To type the Cambodian currency sign, press (Shift + Caps Lock + R).

- Vowel killer diacritics are located at the space key like other Indic script typers.
However, there are more vowel killer characters here in Khmer including characters that kill the whole consonant and vowel, and not just the vowel.

This program also features a way to write the Khmer month calendar symbols of which there are thirty + two characters.
I believe they represent the days of the month and they are typed by pressing and holding the scroll lock key and typing starting from the top row '1' key.
Consult the "Khmer Keyboard Layout (ScrollLock-Roya-Hold).png" to see a screenshot of these.

Like all of my other Indic typing systems, I recommend the use of the following programs together for a better typing experience.
Holdable caps lock, khmer-typer-helper, and maatra helper (character replacer) alongside this keyboard layout program.
