Khmer Typer;

A particularly difficult script developed based on the Devanagari script.

Every letter can be written under other letters as a subscript letter in this alphabet.
To write letters this way, you just hit right alt key, hold it, and type the letters normally.
Another way to do this is to press ctrl + space and then type the letter.

"Khmer a-series consonants"
"Khmer o-series consonants"

"Khmer a-series consonants" come first, while the "Khmer o-series consonants" come second.
Aspirated variants go on caps lock keys like in Devanagari.

- This script has its own colon character which can be typed by pressing caps lock +semicolon key.
Otherwise it will type the regular semicolon and colon.
- The top row number keys exclusively have diacritics and some vowel markers.
- To type the Cambodian currency sign, press (Shift + Caps Lock + R).
- Vowel killer diacritics are located at the space key like other Indic script typers.
However, there are more vowel killer characters here in Khmer including characters that kill the whole consonant and vowel, and not just the vowel.

This program also features a way to write the Khmer month calendar symbols of which there are thirty-two characters.
I believe they represent the days of the month and they are typed by pressing and holding the scroll lock key and typing starting from the top row '1' key.
