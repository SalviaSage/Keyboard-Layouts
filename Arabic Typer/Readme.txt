This is my attempt at trying to make a QWERTY  alphabet for the Arabic script.
This is my first attempt at creating a right to left keyboard layout, but I think I managed it well.
First of all, I just want to say, if your cursor is on the left side of the page. Your computer program is in LTR (left to right) mode and it thinks
that you are writing from left to right. But this is not the case with the Arabic script.
This will make it really difficult for typing Arabic as after you type the words, you may find that your cursor jumps to the wrong side of the screen.
That is, it does not work the way it should.

However, this problem can be remedied by using a text editor or a program that supports RTL typing.
I had to find some programs that support that option myself, as simply switching the keyboard, does not change the programs own settings from LTR (left to right) to RTL (right to left).

Otherwise, I substituted the right facing question mark and comma and things like that to get around these RTL problems.

Again, just like the Cyrillic alphabet that I made, this layout aims to be multilingual and be able to type any language that is written with the Perso-Arabic script.
Such as Ottoman Turkish, Arabic, Farsi, Urdu and other ones. Although, I don't know how well it supports Nastaliq or Shahmukhi.

All of the "emphatic" consonant forms are intentionally placed at caps lock positions.

+ What is tatweel, also known as Kasheeda?
This is basically one stroke of empty horizontal line. It is used only to lengthen the words out, it is just an empty line and it is not a letter.
This character can be accessed by pressing caps+/.


Fathah is at 'e'
Dammah is at 'u'
Kasrah is at 'i'

Fathathan is at shift + e
Dammatan is at shift + u
Kasrathan is at shift + i

Those versions just add the "n" sound at the end of those vowel pronunciations. So they are 'en', 'un' and 'in' and not long vowels.
They do not represent two of those short vowels or one of those short vowels pronounced as a long vowel.
In arabic, to write the long vowels you would first use the Fathah + alif, kasrah + ya, damma + waw
It is a mistake to write the long vowels using the Fathathan, Dammatan and Kasrathan.
Although, if you don't know this you may think it marks a long vowel, since it is two strokes of the same fathah, kasrah and dammah which show vowels.

The characters  "arabic letter mark", "right to left mark", "left to right mark" are all at shift+f, caps+f and caps+shift+f positions.

The digits are all also there, including the variant digits at positions 4, 5, 6 accessed by pressing the caps lock and the caps lock + shift keys.

The "Rial sign" is also in there as a currency unit, next to the dollar signt.

The "shaddah" and the "sukoon" are both at the letter 'o' position because there isn't an 'o' letter in Arabic.
So, I filled it with these diacritics instead.

The letter "hamza" 'ุก' is where the 'c' key is since there is no 'c' in the Arabic alphabet.

Even though the arabic script is written from right to left, its numerals are numerals are written and read left-to-right.
So, this is the same practice as in Latin writing, so we don't have to worry about this.
The computer seems to recognise this fact, so we don't have to manually change the direction when we type numbers it seems.

Also, the backspace and the delete buttons are working correctly, as computer seems to be reversing them as well when we switch to Arabic.

The letters also immediately connect to themselves and the computer seems to be handling the initial, medial and final forms of the letters.
If you want to type the individual letters, you will have to hit space after you type each letter.

There is also a way to type these unconnecting letters without hitting space, but we would need a keyboard with the isolated arabic letters instead.
Those seem to be programmed not to join each other.

Some of the math characters also have to be different because of the direction issues.
There is also the Arabic percent sign and Arabic permil sign which just replaces the 0s wth Arabic script 0s. That's all they do.
They are at the numpad positions shift+/, shift+*, shift+-.

The "modifier letters" called "arabic small high" letters are located at the numpad.
So, we can not write the numbers using the numpad.
I believe these are used in Qur'an typesettings.
