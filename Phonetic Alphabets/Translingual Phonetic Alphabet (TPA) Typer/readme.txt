Typable Method for the Translingual Phonetic Alphabet;
This program is the typable method for the Unicode phonetic alphabet which I created.

It is similar to the IPA, the International Phonetic Alphabet, with the idea of being able to type out the way words are pronounced in different languages with the highest accuracy. It is important to note that the TPA uses the curly brackets to mark phonetic notation, located at the ( [ ) and ( ] ) keys on the keyboard.

This alphabet is a lower-case alphabet, including the vowel letters, which are all the size of lower-case letters. Some consonant letters are the size of upper-case letters.

This alphabet does not have superscript letters or subscript letters. That makes it easier.

The alphabet features combining diacritical marks that go above the letters or below the letters. There are tone markers and many combining diacritics to mark phonological and phonetic phenomena found in language.

The base keys are the same more or less, except the letters (i) and (j), they do not have dots on top of them. The top row number keys are taken out to accommodate more letters.

The numpad keys (0), (.), (1), (2), (3) contain tone markers going from low tone to high tone.

All velaric consonant letters, which are not used in the pronunciation of world languages are located at the numpad (+) key. They are letters with bars going over them, such as ŧ, ꞙ, ᵽ.

The combining diacritics for connecting two letters or connecting words are located next to the backspace key.

The arrow keys, for marking ejective consonants, implosive consonants, egressive and ingressive markers are located below the backspace key. They are correctly used after letters such as { t↑ } and not { ↑t }.

Syllable dividers and morphological dividers are located at the (.) key.

Shift+space gives the long vowel marker (ː).
Control+space gives a line below a letter (macron). This line is supposed to be correctly used to mark stressed vowels. Its double-letter form for covering two vowels such as diphthongs can be typed by pressing shift+control+space.
