Armenian Typer;

This layout lets you type the Armenian Alphabet.

I tried to keep the letters in alignment with where the letters are on the QWERTY layout, the letter "q" is not there however and so it was assigned to another letter.

Using the caps lock button is the only way to type capital letters.
Pressing shift gives us extra and variant letters.
These letters are supposed to relate to the base keys.

For some of them, there are no alternative letters, in which case pressing shift+key gives nothing.
