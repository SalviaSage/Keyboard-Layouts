Adds the capacity to type superscript letters. they are basically miniscule letters that are written on the top side of a line as opposed to "subscript" letters which is the same thing but written on the bottom side of a line.

a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z
ᵃ ᵇ ᶜ ᵈ ᵉ ᶠ ᵍ ʰ ⁱ ʲ ᵏ ˡ ᵐ ⁿ ᵒ ᵖ q ʳ ˢ ᵗ ᵘ ᵛ ʷ ˣ ʸ ᶻ

Again, just as it is the case with the "Small Caps" the "Q" is problematic and the superscript "q" actually doesn't exist in Unicode

A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z
ᴬ ᴮ C ᴰ ᴱ F ᴳ ᴴ ᴵ ᴶ ᴷ ᴸ ᴹ ᴺ ᴼ ᴾ Q ᴿ S ᵀ ᵁ ⱽ ᵂ X Y Z
It also has capital letter support for the above letters, C,F,Q,S,X,Y,Z are the letters that do not have Unicode designation.

This is something that I can not fix but Unicode can possibly fix it from their end if they choose to do so.
I personally think that the full set should be in Unicode. Right now, neither set is full with the smallcase superscript letters missing the letter "q" and the capital case superscript letters missing 7 letters: C, F, Q, S, X, Y, Z.

Also, it has full number support:

0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 - + ( )
⁰ ¹ ² ³ ⁴ ⁵ ⁶ ⁷ ⁸ ⁹ ⁻ ⁺ ⁽ ⁾
