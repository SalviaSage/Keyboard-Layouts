Adds the capacity to type superscript letters. they are basically miniscule letters that are written on the bottom side of a line
as opposed to "superscript" letters which is the same thing but written on the above side of a line.

a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z
ₐ ᵦ ᵪ d ₑ ᵩ ᵧ ₕ ᵢ ⱼ ₖ ₗ ₘ ₙ ₒ ₚ ᵨ ᵣ ₛ ₜ ᵤ ᵥ ₔ ₓ y z

Again, just as it is the case with the "Superscript letters" there are missing letters and I covered the missing sections with Greek subscript letters as they can be useful.

Also, has full number support:
₀ ₁ ₂ ₃ ₄ ₅ ₆ ₇ ₈ ₉ ₋ ₊ ₍ ₎ 
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 - + ( )
