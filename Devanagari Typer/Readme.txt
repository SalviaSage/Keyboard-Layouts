Version 5: 2021-07-11

I created this alphabet, after having created the same kind of thing for Greek.
It is an easy way to type Devanagari, and does not require retraining your muscle memory.

You should use the toggleable caps lock script, found here for better typing.

Devanagari Typer, based on the Latin Qwerty layout. Easy to use.

The base keys have the consonants and the maatra (diacritic) forms of the vowels.
If you want the independent forms of the vowels, then hit the Caps lock key + vowel key.
If you hit the shift key + vowel key you get long maatra vowels instead.
And similarly, hit caps lock + shift + vowel key to get independent long vowels.

The retroflex consonants are accessed by pressing the caps lock key where their dental / alveolar counterparts are.
The aspirated consonants are accessed by pressing the shift key where their unaspirated counterparts are.

The "Z" key is the "nuqta" and the q key is the "anusvaar".
The "nuqta" adds a single dot below the letter while the "anusvaar" adds a single dot above the letter.

The shift + "Q" key is the "candra" and the "candrabindu" diacritics.

The dollar sign is also replaced with the Rupee sign. Also if you hit caps lock + 6 you get "Rs" which is rupees in letters.

The F key is the "viraam" key and is also used to make conjunct consonants.
The "Zero-Width Joiner" is also here. It is supposed to help with the conjunct characters, but the viraam seems to do the job just fine most of the time.

The X key has the devanagri abbreviation symbol as well as some vedic stress markers.

This form of the letter "D" is also in `ॸ` and you can type it by hitting SHIFT+ CTRL + ALT + D or Shift + Right Alt + D.

The retroflex "L" is also at the position of Capslock + "L", even though this is not a thing in Hindi, but it is a thing in south Indian languages.

The "danda" and the "double danda" are at the period key. They serve the same function as the period in the Latin alphabet.

The digits are also replaced with the devanagri digits `0123456789` such as `०१२३४५६७८९`

Doesn't really have all of the Vedic extensions except for the stress symbols like the svarita, udatta and the anudatta which I thought was very imporant.
But the layout is always subject to change and can be improved later.
