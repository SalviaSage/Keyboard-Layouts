I was frustrated that the English Qwerty keyboard did not offer an easy way to write Turkish variants of the Latin letters.
So I came up with a very easy way to write Turkish.

You just have to press shift to type the modified letters and everything else is the same.

The modified extra letters are accessed by pressing the shift key.

The console key has been assigned to be the circumflex accent which is sometimes used in some words.
I put the macron there to mark long vowels although that is typically not done in orthography, it is useful.
I also put the below macron there for marking stress.

I put the Turkish currency sign where the dollar sign is as well.
