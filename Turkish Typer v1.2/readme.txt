I was frustrated that the English Qwerty keyboard did not offer an easy way to write Turkish variants of the Latin letters.
So I came up with a very easy way to write Turkish, Azeri and Kurdish Latin alphabets.

You just have to press shift to type the modified letters and everything else is the same and it is trilingual!
