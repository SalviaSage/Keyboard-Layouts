Korean Typer;

The keyboard layout does contain the four obsolete letters.
They are typed by pressing AltGr+Letter key.

Contains double letter variations of some consonants by pressing shift and consonant letter.

Contains vowel variants when pressing shift + vowel letter.

The letter "ieung" (á„‹) is located at the "q" position.
This letter is used before vowel letters.
Vowel letters are not used on their own at the start of syllables.

All consonants typically come in two formats, the regular top format and the caps lock bottom format.
That is, if the consonant is at the end of a syllable, we have to press caps lock + consonant letter to get the syllable final form of the consonant.
The typer helper program makes it so that when we press and hold the consonant letters it moves these letters to the bottom of the syllable.
This makes it so that we don't always have to press caps lock to type syllable final consonants.

The top row keys do not contain any letters as the keys below contain all of the letters.

There are two obsolete Korean diacritical marks located at AltGr+=(equals) and Shift+AltGr+=(equals) keys.

Hangul jungseong filler (U+1160) located at ctrl+spacebar.
	This character is supposed to be used AFTER consonant letters to make them standalone (non-syllable) letters.
Hangul choseong filler (U+115F) located at shift+ctrl+spacebar.
	This character is supposed to be used BEFORE vowel letters to make them standalone (non-syllable) letters.

In certain less developed text fields and platforms the Korean characters will not correctly join each other and write as separate syllables.
This practically makes the alphabet unusable in that scenario.
But I saw that during my testing, most of the more developed platforms support character joining appropriately.
