# Small Capital Typer

This layout lets you type capital letters at the size of small-case letters such as:

A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z  
ᴀ ʙ ᴄ ᴅ ᴇ ꜰ ɢ ʜ ɪ ᴊ ᴋ ʟ ᴍ ɴ ᴏ ᴘ ꞯ ʀ ꜱ ᴛ ᴜ ᴠ ᴡ x ʏ ᴢ

Out of these, only "Q" is problematic and does not seem to work. I can't fix this from my end.  
(UPDATE: Issue with 'ꞯ' fixed on Windows 11 version 22H2.)

And so, in this new version, which I call the alternate version, I got around the problem of the "Q" letter not displaying properly. I use the latin small letter o with ogonek, U+01EB, which makes it look like it's a small capital Q. Type it that way by hitting shift while caps lock is on.

A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z  
ᴀ ʙ ᴄ ᴅ ᴇ ꜰ ɢ ʜ ɪ ᴊ ᴋ ʟ ᴍ ɴ ᴏ ᴘ ǫ ʀ ꜱ ᴛ ᴜ ᴠ ᴡ x ʏ ᴢ

Also of note is that the small cap "X" does not exist in Unicode. So I substituted the small-case "x" there instead. It looks exactly the way it would look anyway. So, I think we got away there... We now have an almost perfect system of typing the small caps, yes there are 2 issues there that I can not fix, but over time I have found good ways to get around them. (One of them have been fixed.)

So, what use is this? Well, it can be useful for typesetting and give you an extra way of typing things aside from the italics and the bold letters. Also, it is really good to use with Latin language texts, since historically, the Latin language did not have small case letters anyway. There are also these ligatures that are helpful:

ɶ latin letter small capital oe (U+0276)
ᴁ latin letter small capital ae (U+1D01)

Also, you can type the roman numerals 1 - 12 on the digit keys.
