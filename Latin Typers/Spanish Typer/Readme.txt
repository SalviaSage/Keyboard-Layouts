Spanish Typer;

The acute accent (acento) can be typed by pressing control+space.
The diaeresis (diéresis) can be typed by pressing control+shift+space.

The accented letters are at 1 to 6 keys.
The ordinal indicators can be typed by pressing the 7 and 8 keys.
The inverted exclamation mark and the inverted question mark is at the 9 and 0 keys.

The "ü" is at the '{' key.
The "ñ" is at the '}' key.

In the alternate version, "w" and "ñ" change places.
In the "Old Spanish Typer", the only difference is that the '\' key (next to the "ñ" key) has been replaced with the letter 'ç'.
