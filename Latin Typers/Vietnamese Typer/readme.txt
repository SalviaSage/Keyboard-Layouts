Vietnamese Typer;

Fully types the Vietnamese Latin alphabet.

Type the tonal diacritics by first typing the vowel and then pressing the top row number keys 1 to 5.
The diacritics are in the correct order as discussed here:

Press the (6) key to type the Vietnamese currency symbol, dong.

When we add a combining diacritic on top of the letter (i) the computer automatically removes the dot that is on top of the letter and replaces it with a diacritic.
This is the default correct behaviour on the computer.
If we want to preserve the dot above and add more diacritics above it, we can do so by pressing the ctrl+spacebar key and then pressing 1-5 to add the diacritic.
However, this can fail search entries for that word as typically this is not done when typing in Vietnamese.
I also recommend not typing that way.
It is just that, this program allows us to preserve the tittle if we want to.

List of changed keys pertaining to the program;
The letter (ă) is at the (z) key.
The letter (â) is at the (w) key.
The letter (ê) is at the (Backslash \ ) key.
The letter (ô) is at the (]) key.
The letter (ơ) is at the ([) key.
The letter (ư) is at the (j) key.

The letter (đ) is at the (f) key.
The letter (ƀ) is at the (j) key.

I assigned the letters found in the Vietnamese alphabet to the letters F, J, W, and Z because Vietnamese words are not spelled with those letters.

Due to the large number of tonal letters, I also made an IME for Vietnamese so the tonal letters can be picked by pressing vowel letter+tab.

This keyboard layout gives us "composite characters" as opposed to "precomposed" characters.
That is, we type letter and the diacritic, the diacritic is placed on the letter separately and will be deleted first when using backspace.
All of the letters are also encoded in Unicode as precomposed characters, that is, the letter and the diacritic as one character.
This is better in terms of saving data-size and can have some advantages but also disadvantages.
You can automatically convert the letters to precomposed after typing them with this keyboard using the Hotstrings.exe library "Vietnamese Precomposed Character Replacer.csv".
