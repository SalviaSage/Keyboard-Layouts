Vietnamese Typer;

Fully types the Vietnamese Latin alphabet.
Switch between Vietnamese Latin alphabet and English Latin alphabet by pressing the scroll lock key.

Type the tonal diacritics by first typing the vowel and pressing the top row number keys 1 to 5.
They are in the correct order as discussed here:

Press the (6) key to type the Vietnamese currency symbol, dong.
Sometimes this symbol will look too small or above similar to a superscript.
In this case, we can get around the problem by pressing (7) to type a letter that looks like this symbol.

When we add a diacritic on top of the letter 'i' the computer automatically removes the dot that is on top of the letter
and replaces it with a diacritic. This is the default correct behaviour on the computer.
However, if we want to preserve the dot and add diacritics above it, we can do so by pressing the (9) key.
Same is true for the capital letter by pressing the (0) key.
However, this can fail the search entries for that word as typically this is not done when typing in Vietnamese.
I also recommend not typing that way.
However, this program allows us to preserve the tittle if we want to.
