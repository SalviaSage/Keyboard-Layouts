I was frustrated that the English QWERTY keyboard did not offer an easy way to write the Turkish variants of the Latin letters.
So I came up with a very easy way to write Turkish.

You just have to press shift to type the modified letters and everything else is the same.

The modified extra letters are accessed by pressing the shift key.

I put the Turkish currency sign where the dollar sign is as well.

Also, it fully types German and Azeri as well.

There are some extra combining diacritics located by the numpad.
