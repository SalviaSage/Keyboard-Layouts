Underlined Typer;

Types the letters and numbers with a line going under them.
Does this directly from Unicode and no outside formatting.

For this reason, there are some problems with letters that have descenders such as (q, g, y).
It may be better to use markdown formatting where it is supported such as with <u> text </u>

Also, the underline is off to the right or left too much for the numbers and some punctuation marks.
