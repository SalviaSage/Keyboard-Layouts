Superscripts Typer;

Adds the capacity to type superscript letters.
They are basically small letters that are written on the top side of a line as opposed to "subscript" letters which is the same thing but written on the bottom side of a line.

·µÉ ·µá ·∂ú ·µà ·µâ ·∂† ·µç  ∞ ·∂¶  ≤ ·µè À° ·µê ·∂∞ ·µí ·µñ êû•  ≥ À¢ ·µó ·µò ·µõ  ∑ À£  ∏ ·∂ª

The superscript q (êû•) was recently added to Unicode, but Windows and its web browser already shows the character appropriately.
In case it doesn't, the letter, '·µ†` modifier letter small greek phi (U+1D60) is located where the 's' key is. It is there because it looks somewhat similar to the letter 'q'.
I also made a small change to the letters i and n due to the way they are encoded in unicode separately from the rest of the superscript set, they look bigger than the rest of the superscript letters.
This causes these letters to stand out and look inappropriately, therefore I substituted them with a dotless i and a small capital N at those positions.
But the original letters can still be typed with the shift + caps lock combination.

It also has capital letter support for the below letters. 'S, X, Y, Z' are the capital letters that do not have Unicode designations.
A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z

To type these, you just hit the shift key.

Also, it has full number support:

0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 - + ( )
‚Å∞ ¬π ¬≤ ¬≥ ‚Å¥ ‚Åµ ‚Å∂ ‚Å∑ ‚Å∏ ‚Åπ ‚Åª ‚Å∫ ‚ÅΩ ‚Åæ
