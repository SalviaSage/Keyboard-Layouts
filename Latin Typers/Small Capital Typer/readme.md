# Small Capital Typer

This layout lets you type capital letters at the size of small-case letters such as:

A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z  
ᴀ ʙ ᴄ ᴅ ᴇ ꜰ ɢ ʜ ɪ ᴊ ᴋ ʟ ᴍ ɴ ᴏ ᴘ ꞯ ʀ ꜱ ᴛ ᴜ ᴠ ᴡ x ʏ ᴢ

Out of these, only "Q" is problematic and does not seem to work. I can't fix this from my end.

And so, in this new version, which I call the alternate version, I got around the problem of the "Q" letter not displaying properly. I use the small capital letter o + the combining grave accent below character, U+0316, which makes it "look" like it's a "Q". Type it that way by hitting shift+q. If you want to type the "true capital" "Q", just hit shift+` on the keyboard.

A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z  
ᴀ ʙ ᴄ ᴅ ᴇ ꜰ ɢ ʜ ɪ ᴊ ᴋ ʟ ᴍ ɴ ᴏ ᴘ ᴏ̖ ʀ ꜱ ᴛ ᴜ ᴠ ᴡ x ʏ ᴢ

Also of note is that the small cap "X" does not exist in Unicode. So I substituted the small-case "x" there instead. It looks exactly the way it would look anyway. So, I think we got away there... we now have an almost perfect system of typing the small caps, except for that little issue with the letter "Q" that I mentioned above.

So, what use is this? Well, it can be useful for typesetting, and give you an extra way of typing things aside from the italics and the bold letters. Also, it is really good to use with Latin language texts, since historically, the Latin language did not have small case letters anyway.

Also, you can type the roman numerals 1 - 12 on the digit keys and there are four combining diacritics on the right side on the numpad.
