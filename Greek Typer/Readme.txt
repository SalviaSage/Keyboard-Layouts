This keyboard layout is the same as the default English US keyboard layout
except all the letters have been changed from the Latin alphabet to the Greek alphabet.

Otherwise, the letters are exactly where they are. See the screenshot for further details.

Right now, this alphabet only has the smallcase and the capital case letters and it does not have any kind of ligature
or diacritic support. Although, it does have the letter "stigma" which is technically a ligature of the letters Sigma and Tau.
The stigma key is located at the "w" key, you must press shift on it to get it as well, or you get the word-final Sigma letter.
