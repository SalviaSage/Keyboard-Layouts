QWERTY Greek Alphabet Keyboard Layout:

This keyboard layout is the same as the default English US keyboard layout
except all the letters have been changed from the Latin alphabet to the Greek alphabet.

Most of  the letters are exactly where they are.
See the screenshot for further details.

I intentionally excluded out the historical Greek letters that are no longer used.
I put all or most of the accompanying diacritical marks on the numpad.
If you need some of those diacritical marks, that's where you will find them, on the numpad.

The letter "sigma" has a different letter form when it appears at the end of words.
This is only true for the small letter sigma, not the capitalfdf.
If you want to type that, you just have to press the "w" key on the keyboard.
That's how you are supposed to type words actually, for example: "αδελφοσ"is incorrect and "αδελφος" is correct.

The letter 'χ' 'chi' is where the 'x' key is.
The letter 'ξ' 'ksi' is where the 'c' key is.
The letter 'ψ' 'psi' is where the 'v' key is.
The letter 'θ' 'theta' is where the 'y' key is.
The letter 'ω' 'omega' is where the 'q' key is.

Also, you can switch between typing in the Greek alphabet and the
Latin alphabet by hitting the scroll lock key (kana lock key).
This will also allow you to use the numpad for typing numbers.
