This keyboard layout is the same as the default English US keyboard layout
except all the letters have been changed from the Latin alphabet to the Greek alphabet.

Otherwise, most of  the letters are exactly where they are.
See the screenshot for further details.

I intentionally excluded out the historical Greek letters that are no longer used.
I put all or most of the accompanying diacritical marks on the numpad.
If you need some of those diacritical marks, that's where you will find them, on the numpad.

The numbers can still be typed on the numpad if the user first hits the scroll lock key.

The letter "sigma" has a different letter form when it appears at the end of words.
This is only true for the small-case sigma.
If you want to type that, you just have to press the "w" key on the keyboard.

The letter 'χ' 'chi' is where the 'x' key is.
The letter 'ξ' 'ksi' is where the 'c' key is.
The letter 'ψ' 'psi' is where the 'v' key is.
The letter 'θ' 'theta' is where the 'y' key is.
The letter 'ω' 'omega' is where the 'q' key is.
