This keyboard layout is the same as the default English US keyboard layout
except all the letters have been changed from the Latin alphabet to the Greek alphabet.

Otherwise, most of  the letters are exactly where they are. See the screenshot for further details.

I intentionally excluded out the historical greek letters as well as the polytonic orthography of Greek.
This is the monotonic modern Greek alphabet keyboard layout that I made.

It does have the letter "stigma" which is technically a ligature of the letters Sigma and Tau.
The stigma key is located at the "w" key, you must press shift+w if you want to get the Capital Stigma.

Also it has the letter koppa in both its archaic and modern forms located where the key 'q' is.

If you want to get the "final letter" form of the sigma, you just have to press shift+s.

Also, the "tonos", the accent mark that is used to mark stress is located on the numpad where the '/' key is.
'/' has been moved to the shifted position.

The letter 'chi' is where the 'x' key is. The letter 'ksi' is where the 'c' key is. The letter 'psi' is where the 'v' key is.

It is not really intended to write any kind of an archaic text or the digitisation of arhcaic texts.
