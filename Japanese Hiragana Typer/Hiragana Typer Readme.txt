Hiragana Typer;
It is more or less identical to the Katakana typer.
A very good method for typing in the Hiragana alphabet of Japanese.

To type the "small Hiragana letters", you have to press the shift key.

The 'sokuon', which geminates consonants can be typed by pressing shift + - key or shift + t key.
The 'small ke' is at the same location but is accessed by pressing caps + shift + - key.
The 'ん' letter can be typed at the 'q' key.
The 'ち' letter can be typed at the 'c' key.
The 'し' letter can be typed at the 'x' key.
The 'じ' letter can be typed at the 'j' key.
The 'ふ' letter can be typed at the 'f' key.
The 'ゔ' letter can be typed at the 'v' key.
The 'ぢ' letter can be typed at the 'l' key.

Some of the archaic letters such as wu, yi and ye can not be typed even though they are in Unicode.
This is because they are located in another section of Unicode and the program could not work with them appropriately.
So I deleted them.

Press the scroll lock key to type in latin letters.
