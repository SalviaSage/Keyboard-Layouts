Open settings and go to "Time & language".
Select "Language & region" and click "Add a language".
From here, you can see the list of languages that Microsoft Windows 11 supports.
Pick the language that you want to install such as Spanish (Mexico) or Spanish (Spain).
There may be two or more entries for the same language.
I recommend picking only one of them, for example Spanish (Mexico) and not Spanish (Spain).

You can not translate Windows 11 to that language and use it in that language, unless you download the "language pack".

If you don't want to translate Windows 11 to another language but want to be able to use that target language, do not install the "language pack".
To be able to type in the target language, use text to speech features, and handwriting features, install everything except the "language pack".

Also, do not select "Set as my Windows display language".
This allows us to preserve our own language Windows while giving us better options for using other languages in Windows.

Also, make sure to install fonts that Microsoft provides.

â€‹	How to download and use more fonts with Windows?

Go to the "Settings" window.
Then click "Personalization" and click "Fonts".
Click "Download fonts for all languages".
Before hitting this it says something like "74 fonts found".
Then, after downloading the fonts, it says something like "169 fonts found".
Here we can see a sample of text with fonts, so it is useful in that sense.
