Subscripts Typer;

Adds the capacity to type subscript letters. 
They are basically miniscule letters that are written on the bottom side of a line as opposed to "subscript" letters which is the same thing but written on the top side of a line.
However, in Unicode, the range of these letters are limited. Only 17 out of 26 characters are there.
