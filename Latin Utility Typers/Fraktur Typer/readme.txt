Fraktur Typer;

Types the letters in the Fraktur typeface directly from Unicode.
It is a historic typeface that was popular, especially in German.

Taken from Wikipedia:
Unicode does not encode Fraktur as a separate script.
Instead, Fraktur is considered a "presentation form" of the Latin alphabet.[12][e]
Thus, the additional ligatures that are required for Fraktur typefaces will not be encoded in Unicode:
support for these ligatures is a font engineering issue left up to font developers.[13]

There are, however, two sets of Fraktur symbols in the Unicode blocks of Mathematical Alphanumeric Symbols, Letterlike Symbols, and Latin Extended-E.
The long s, ß, and the umlauted vowels are not encoded, as the characters are meant to be used in mathematics and phonetics, so they are not suitable for typesetting German-language texts.[14]
