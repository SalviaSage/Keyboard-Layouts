Bold Cursive Typer;

These letters look like hand-written letters.
They are used in mathematics and also in signatures and initials.

They can also be used to give a pleasent style and artistry to letters.

The “Bold Cursive” set has all of the smallcase and capital case letters.
It doesn't seem to have any problems.

The “Cursive” set however, is missing some small case and capital case letters.
Similar to the subscript set, it just does not have the full set.

I tried to substitute letters and make it good, but it is not as uniform as the bold cursive set.
Some of the letters have spacing issues, or look too small on the PC but the bold cursive set seems good.
