Bold Cursive Typer;

These letters look like hand-written letters.
They are used in mathematics and also in signatures and initials.

They can be used to give a pleasant style and artistry to letters.

The “Bold Cursive” set has all the small case and capital case letters.
It doesn't seem to have any problems.

The “Cursive” set, however, is missing some small case and capital case letters.
Similar to the subscript set, it does not have the full set.

I tried substituting certain letters, but it is not as uniform as the bold cursive set.
Some letters have spacing issues or look too small, but the  “Bold Cursive” set seems good so it is preferable to use that set.
