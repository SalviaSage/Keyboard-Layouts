US Modified Typer;

It's the same as the US QWERTY keyboard but the top row number keys have been swapped with the shift punctuation marks.
So to type the numbers you press shift then the top row keys or use the numpad.

Swapped:
!@#$%^&*()
1234567890

Not Swapped (default):
1234567890
!@#$%^&*()

It is particularly good for computer programming since numbers can still be typed from the numpad on a full-size keyboard.

Another feature of this keyboard is that it lets you press the Function keys F13~F24 by pressing ctrl+shift+Function keys.
The numpad also has some extra features placed there.
Ctrol+0 gives the degree sign. Ctrl+dot gives the decimal separator comma.
