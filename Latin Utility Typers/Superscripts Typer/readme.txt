Superscripts Typer;

	Adds the capacity to type superscript letters.
They are small letters that are written on the top side of a line as opposed to "subscript" letters that are written on the bottom side of a line.

Albeit, their sizes may not be exactly uniform because of different codepoints.

	It also has capital letter support for the below letters.
To type these, you just hit the shift key.

(S), (X), (Y), (Z) are the capital letters that do not have Unicode designations.
	(S) has been added as of Unicode v17. Still shows up as a square right now (꟱).

	It has full support for numbers:
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 - + ( )
⁰ ¹ ² ³ ⁴ ⁵ ⁶ ⁷ ⁸ ⁹ ⁻ ⁺ ⁽ ⁾

Replaced ⁽ⁱ⁾ with ⁽ᶦ⁾ because of giving unsatisfactory results in all environments.
