Small Capitals Typer;
This layout lets you type capital letters the size of lower-case letters.

Only (ꞯ) is problematic and does not seem to work.
(UPDATE: Issue with (ꞯ) fixed on Windows 11 version 22H2.)

An alternative for (ꞯ) is included as a character that looks alike.
It can be typed by pressing shift+capslock+q.

Also of note is that the small capital (X) does not exist in Unicode.
So I substituted the small-case (x) there instead.
It looks exactly the way it would look, except it is a small-case letter and not a small capital letter.
We now have an almost perfect system of typing the small capitals.

So, what use is this? Well, it can be useful for typesetting and gives you an extra way of typing things aside from the italics and the bold letters.
Also, it is suitable for use with Latin language texts, since historically, the Latin language did not have small case letters anyway.

There are also these ligatures that are helpful located at the ( [ ) and ( ] ) keys.
(ɶ) "latin letter small capital oe" (U+0276)
(ᴁ) "latin letter small capital ae" (U+1D01)

You can type the Roman numerals 1 - 10 on the top row digit keys.
