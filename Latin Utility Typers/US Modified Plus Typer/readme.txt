US Modified Typer;

It's the same as the US QWERTY keyboard but the top row number keys have been swapped with the shift punctuation marks.
So to type the numbers you press shift then the top row keys or use the numpad.

Swapped:
!@#$%^&*()
1234567890

Not Swapped (default):
1234567890
!@#$%^&*()

It is particularly good for computer programming since numbers can still be typed from the numpad on a full-size keyboard.


US Modified Plus Typer;

The "plus" version is the same thing but it removes the top row number keys at the shift positions to type extra symbols.

However, a wakeup key is not defined by the keyboard layout.
