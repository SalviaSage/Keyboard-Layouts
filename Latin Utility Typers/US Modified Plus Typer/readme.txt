US Modified Typer;

It's the same as the US QWERTY keyboard but the top row number keys have been swapped with the shift punctuation marks.
So to type the numbers you press shift then the top row keys or use the numpad.

Swapped:
!@#$%^&*()
1234567890

Not Swapped (default):
1234567890
!@#$%^&*()

It is particularly good for computer programming since numbers can still be typed from the numpad on a full-size keyboard.


US Modified Plus Typer;

The "plus" version is the same thing but it removes the top row number keys at the shift positions to type extra symbols.

Shift+1 "inverted exclamation mark"
Shift+2 "inverted question mark"
Shift+3 "numero sign"
Shift+4 "cent sign"
Shift+5 "per mille sign"
Shift+6 "section sign"
Shift+7 "dagger"
Shift+8 "sextile"
Shift+9 "guillemets left facing"
Shift+0 "guillemets right facing"

A feature of this keyboard is that it lets you press the Function keys F13 to F24 by pressing ctrl+shift+function keys.

Ctrl+Shift+F1  = F13
Ctrl+Shift+F2  = F14
Ctrl+Shift+F3  = F15
Ctrl+Shift+F4  = F16
Ctrl+Shift+F5  = F17
Ctrl+Shift+F6  = F18
Ctrl+Shift+F7  = F19
Ctrl+Shift+F8  = F20
Ctrl+Shift+F9  = F21
Ctrl+Shift+F10 = F22
Ctrl+Shift+F11 = F23
Ctrl+Shift+F12 = F24

The keyboard also features AltGr and the capacity to type smallcase and capital case Greek letters.
This is done by pressing the right alt key  or the ctrl + alt + letter keys on the keyboard.

From the numpad, we can type superscript numbers by pressing AltGr. 0123456789 | ⁰¹²³⁴⁵⁶⁷⁸⁹

Accent marks (diacritics) used in European languages can be typed by pressing AltGr and top row number keys 1-6.

Non-breaking hyphen can be typed by pressing AltGr + hyphen-minus character next to the top row number keys.

Some extra European letters and variations can be typed with the keys right of the letter keys by pressing AltGr.

(…) Ellipsis, or three dots can be typed as a single character by pressing shift+dot.
(·) Middle Dot can be typed by pressing shift+comma.

The numpad also has some extra features placed there.

Ctrol+0 types the degree sign. 
Ctrl+dot types the prime sign.
Ctrl+Numpaddot types the comma for thousands separation.

(÷) "Division Sign" can be typed with shift+num/
"Fraction Slash" can be typed with ctrl+num/ and helps in typing fractions appropriately.

(×) "Multiplication Sign" can be typed with shift+num*
(⋅) "Dot Operator" can be typed with ctrlt+num* which is another way to write multiplication.

(−) "Minus Sign" can be typed with shift+num-

(=) "Equals Sign" can be typed with shift+num+

The following were moved to the numpad:
(<) "Less Than Sign" can be typed with ctrl+num-
(≤) "Less Than or Equal To" can be typed with ctrl+shift+num-

(>) "Greater Than Sign" can be typed with ctrl+num+
(≥) "Greater Than or Equal To" can be typed with ctrl+shift+num+

ctrl+\backslash types double vertical line (‖).

The key next to the backspace key has also been changed with en-dash and em-dash characters.
The plus and the equals sign has to be typed from the numpad.

The sleep/standby key can be pressed by pressing ctrl+shift+pause key.
I added this feature because not all keyboards have a separate sleep key.
Break/cancel key is still normally pressed with the ctrl+pause key.
