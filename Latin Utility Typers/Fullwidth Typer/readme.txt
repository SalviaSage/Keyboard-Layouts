Fullwidth Typer;

Types the regular US QWERTY keyboard, except everything is in fullwidth size.
Fullwidth spacing is particularly important in Japanese, Korean and Chinese typing.

Fullwidth characters are about twice as wide as regular characters.
They take three times as much data space as regular characters at three bytes per character.

This is because logograph characters are made up of many multiple strokes and markings and require wider space.
