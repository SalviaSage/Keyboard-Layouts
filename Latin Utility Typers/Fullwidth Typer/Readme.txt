Fullwidth Typer;

Types the regular US QWERTY keyboard except everything is in fullwidth size.
Fullwidth spacing is something that is particularly important in Japanese, Korean and Chinese typing.

Basically, these letters are about twice as wide as regular letters.
They also take about 3 times as much size on the disk.

This is because letters or logographs are made up of many multiple strokes and markings in East Asian typing.
This also makes it easier to read them and gives us the necessary spacing.
