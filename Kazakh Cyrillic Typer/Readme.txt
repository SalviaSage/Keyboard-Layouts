Kazakh Cyrillic Typer is a version of the Slavic Cyrillic Typer layout which aims to write the Kazakh language in the Cyrillic alpabet.
Even though the Kazakh language is now officially being written with the Latin alphabet and "Latinization" is in progress.

With this keyboard layout, we should be able to type in Cyrillic and it is based on the QWERTY layout.
The letters are exactly where their QWERTY equivalents are, so you shouldn't have difficulty typing from muscle memory.

For example, hitting 'L' will give you 'Л'. Hitting 'D' will give you 'Д'.
The exemptions to these are:
Hitting 'W' will give you 'Ш' because there is no "W" in Cyrillic.
Hitting 'Q' will give you the soft sign 'ь' and hitting "Shift+H" will give you the hard sign "ъ'.

Keep in mind that the letters are based on the sounds they make and not what they look like.
So, "C" is where "S" is and so on. The letter 'Ч' is where the letter 'C' is.

If you want to type the capital letters, you will have to hit the caps lock key. The shift key will never give you any capital letters.
It will give you extra letters or same letters instead.

Also, the acute accent, which can be combined with vowels, to mark stress is where the ' - ' key is on the numpad.
The combining umlaut (diaeresis) which can be combined with certain letters is where the ' / ' key is on the numpad.
The combining inverted breve which can be combined with certain letters is where the ' * ' key is on the numpad.
The combining macron which can be combined with certain letters is where the ' + ' key is on the numpad.

This helps us type some additional letters used in some orthographies.

The Tenge sign is located where the Dollar sign is, digit four, on the keyboard.
It can be typed by pressing shift + caps lock + 4. The Ruble Sign is typed the same way, but it is located on digit 5.
The Euro Sign is typed the same way, but it is located on digit 6.

Russian style quotation marks are where the quotation mark and semicolon keys are.
Russian style "fir tree" quotation marks are where the less than and greater than sign keys are.
They are accessed by holding down the shift + caps lock keys.

I recommend running the "holdable caps lock" AutoHotkey script in the background because the caps lock key is being used as a modifier key in this layout.
This is a necessary step in order to be able to type more letters.

Letters unique to cyrillic like ya, yo, ye, yu are where the vowel letters like a, o, e, u are located.
They are accessed by hitting shift + vowel keys.
