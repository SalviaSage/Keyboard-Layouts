Old Italic (Etruscan) Typer;
This alphabet is the direct ancestor of the Latin alphabet.
Many of its letters also look similar to capital-case Latin alphabet letters.
This is because there were no small case letters in use at that time and that small case letters were a later innovation.

Shift does not give us variant letters.
There are some limited digits on the numpad.
