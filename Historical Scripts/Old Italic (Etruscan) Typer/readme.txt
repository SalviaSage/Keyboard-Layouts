Old Italic (Etruscan) Typer;
This alphabet is the direct ancestor of the Latin alphabet.
Many of its letters also look similar to capital-case Latin alphabet letters.
This is because there were no small case letters in use at that time and that small case letters were a later innovation.

Shift does not give us variant letters.
There are some limited digits on the numpad.

The computer recognises this script as left-to-right, although historically, right-to-left was also valid.

For right-to-left script direction support, you have to press the '0' key on the keyboard after every letter.
Some letters will still face the wrong direction, this can only be overcome by the use of certain fonts.

Specifically, the Brill Epichoric font is the only font capable of giving us correct glyphs for the use of the script with a right-to-left direction.
This is achieved by the use of the private use area codes.

Phoenician word separator, a kind of a middle dot, can be typed by pressing ctrl+space.
Two dot separator, can be typed by pressing ctrl+shift+space.
