Coptic Typer;
A computer program that lets you type in the Coptic Alphabet.

This alphabet is a variant of the Greek alphabet, however, it has its own Unicode section.
The base keys are the same as the "Greek Typer Layout".
But pressing the top row number keys gives us some extra keys.

It may be that Coptic text is not supported or looks wrong.
Using certain fonts specifically made for Coptic will alleviate this problem.

Does not have support for "Coptic Epact Numbers" 102E0-102FF.

Coptic does not have its language designation in Windows, so it is saved under "English-US".
