Old Turkic (Orkhon & Yenisei) Typer;

This keyboard layout program allows us to type the "Turkic Runes" without much difficulty.
To type the variant letters or extra letters found in the "Yenisei" version, hit the scroll lock (Kana) key.

Caps lock does not modify anything and can not be used here due to technical limitations.

Letters typically have a back vowel form and a front vowel form.
We type the back vowel form by default and type the front vowel forms by hitting the caps lock key or the shift key plus the key we want to type.
