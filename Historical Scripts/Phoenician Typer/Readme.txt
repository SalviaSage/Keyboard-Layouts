Phoenician Typer;

This alphabet is the direct ancestor of the Latin alphabet.
Many of its letters also look similar to capital case Latin letters.

This is because there was no small case letters in use at that time and that
small case letters were a later innovation.

The arrangement of the letters is a mix of the way they look and their phonetic correspondences.
However, here, the phonetic values of the letters would be different.

NOTE: THIS ALPHABET IS WRITTEN RIGHT TO LEFT.
