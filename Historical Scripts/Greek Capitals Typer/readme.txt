Greek Capitals Typer;
This keyboard layout is the same as the Greek Typer keyboard layout
except all the letters are in capitals and there are additional capital letters where the top row number keys are.

Most of the letters are exactly where they are.
See the screenshots for further details.

The letter (χ) "chi" is where the (x) key is.
The letter (ξ) "'ksi" is where the (j) key is.
The letter (ψ) "psi" is where the (v) key is.
The letter (θ) "theta" is where the (u) key is.
The letter (ω) "omega" is where the (w) key is.

I thought the capital letters may have historical significance so I made this keyboard layout.
I also believe they are read easily.
