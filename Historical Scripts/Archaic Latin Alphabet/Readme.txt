Archaic Latin Typer;
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_alphabet

This alphabet is the direct ancestor of the English Latin alphabet.
It doesn't have the letters U, W and J as they are later derivations from V and I.

Also, G is an innovation from C by adding a stroke.
It was created to differentiate the /g/ sound from the /k/ sound.

It types the capital letters the size of small letters (small capitals).
However, it may be better to type directly in capitals as these support combining diacritics better.

Pressing shift+spacebar gives us the combining macron which is used on vowels to indicate long vowels.
