Old Turkic (Orkhon & Yenisei) Typer;
This keyboard layout program allows us to type the "Turkic Runes" without much difficulty.
To type the Yenisei variant letters or extra letters found in the "Yenisei" version, hit the scroll lock (Kana) key.

Not all letters have Yenisei variants, in that case, you will type the Orkhon variants.

Letters typically have a back vowel form and a front vowel form.
We type the back vowel form by default and type the front vowel forms by hitting the caps lock key or the shift key plus the key we want to type.

The direction of writing has to be right to left.
The historical word separator, the two dot punctuation can be typed by pressing ctrl+space.
Historical word separator, the ring point can be typed by pressing shift+ctrl+space.
