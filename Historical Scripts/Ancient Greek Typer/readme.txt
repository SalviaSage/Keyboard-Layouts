Ancient Greek Typer;
This keyboard layout is the same as the Greek Typer keyboard layout;
except all the letters are in capitals and there are additional capital letters where the top row number keys are.

Most of the letters are exactly where they are.
See the screenshots for further details.

The letter (χ) "chi" is where the (x) key is.
The letter (ξ) "'ksi" is where the (j) key is.
The letter (ψ) "psi" is where the (v) key is.
The letter (θ) "theta" is where the (u) key is.
The letter (ω) "omega" is where the (w) key is.


Instructions for boustrophedon writing;

This keyboard layout intentionally supports boustrophedon style of writing.
To write boustrophedon, we need to use the "Brill Epichoric" font.
In this style, the texts alternate lines going from left-to-right, then right-to-left and so on.
To write this way, the typist has to press ctrl+enter to go to the next line.
This inserts the right-to-left override (U+202E) character, which has to be inserted for every retrograde line.
They also have to press ctrl+rightshift to bring the keyboard caret to the right side of the screen.
(This is only possible if a right-to-left writing language support such as Arabic or Hebrew is installed in the system settings.)
They then have to turn on CapsLock so that the glyphs of the letters face the right direction such as the letter "E" and "B" for example.
The typist can run the boustrophedon script, this will make it so that pressing ctrl+enter will turn on capslock while pressing enter turns off capslock.
