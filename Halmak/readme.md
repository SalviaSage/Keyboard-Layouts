The installable keyboard layout for the Halmak layout. Which was made by an AI to be the easiest typable keyboard there ever is.
I also think that it is the best keyboard layout for key placement and finger movement efficiency.

But, it requires re-training your muscle memory from qwerty.
Which of course makes you very slow, but it can be useful if you want to be a "dual" typist.

I do think it is better than Colemak and other layouts so I made an installer for Halmak.
