I wanted to make the Gurmukhi typer after I made the Devanagari typer.
The number of Gurmukhi unicode characters are less than the Devanagari letters.

So, the keyboard has more or less full representation of all of the Gurmukhi characters.

There are few differences between the two keyboards.

Most of the keys are the same places as to where the Devanagari letters are in the Devanagari keyboard layout that I made.
I also created a new letter to write the 'ʒ' sound, 'ਜ਼਼', which can already be done in Devanagari, but not in Gurmukhi.
I took the letter 'ਜ਼' and added one more dot under it.

Have fun typing.
