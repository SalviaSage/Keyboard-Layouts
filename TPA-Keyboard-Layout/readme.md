TPA Keyboard Layout v4.9 for the TPA typable method on Windows 10.

This is the typable keyboard layout for the phonetic alphabet which I created which can be found here:
https://github.com/SalviaSage/Translingual-Phonetic-Alphabet

It was really difficult to develop this alphabet and at first it wasn't easy to type with.
This is because it has about 20 vowel letters and about 250 contoid letters.
It has to have that many letters plus about 150 combining diacritics to support aditional functions.

(1) Basically, the TPA is a caseless alphabet, so, the caps lock in its traditional use is useless. 
Since the TPA has a lot of letters, we need to use the caps lock key as a modifier key in addition to the shift and ctrl+alt keys.
I avoid using the CTRL key alone as a modifier in my layouts because they tend to be used by programs as hotkeys.
Also, the right alt key is set to be the same thing as ctrl+alt key in this layout.

I developed an AutoHotkey script for switching the Caps Lock key into holdable instead of toggleable.
It basically makes Caps Lock work just like the shift key, it turns it into a modifier key.

I recommend running this script in the background when typing the TPA. It definitely makes things easier.
It is turned on by default but it can be suspended by right clicking its tray icon and hitting suspend.
It also retains the toggle feature of caps lock but you need to hit the caps lock key twice instead of once to get that feature.


(2) The number keys above the letter keys are also being used to type additional letters.
Because the TPA has upwards of about 275 letters, those keys have been assigned for this purpose.
The F keys above those are left alone and can not be modified anyway.

(3) The numpad is exclusively being used to type the combining diacritics of the TPA.
Because the TPA has and needs so many combining diacritics that go both above the individual letters and below the individual letters, the numpad has to be occupied for this purpose. The superscript numbers however, can still be typed by hitting the 'ctrl+al't or the 'right alt' key plus the number keys on top of the letters. The "normal" numbers can be typed by hitting the same keys, except you also have to press the shift key. (shift+alt+ctrl or shift+right alt)

This layout does not contain any superscript letters. Unlike the IPA, these are not a part of the TPA.
We use combining diacritics instead. Such as combining diacritic letters. But, the superscripts, the smallcaps and the subscript letters and numbers can all be typed with my other respective layouts anyway.

(4) The "retroflex" letters are accessed with the caps lock key just as it is in my Devanagari keyboard layout.

(5) Access aditional letters by hitting shift. The vowel letters on the keyboard give you additional vowel letters, while the consonant letters give you additional consonant letters.

(6) The numpad is being used for typing the combining diacritics of the TPA.
This allows us to show various different co-articulations and phenomena.

(7) Other than these main differences, the base small case letters are exactly the same as in English and are found at the same locations except for the i and the j which have their dots removed.

This is because the TPA makes use of "above combining diacritics" as it is shown above.

(8) Also, the letter g is changed from U+0067 to "script g" U+0261. That is '` g '` into ' ɡ ' to prevent it from being shown as the double story g as seen here. Outside of those three differences, the other letters are the same on the base layout.

(9) Shift + vowel letter gives you a more broad, open version of the vowel while hitting the CAPS key gives you another vowel.

(10) The font you are supposed to use with this alphabet is a font called CODE2000.
Which you can find it, being hosted by me, here: https://github.com/SalviaSage/Fonts-Repository

This seems to be the best font, but it is not perfect.

(11) You also get a whole set of brackets, where the bracket keys normally are. And even more punctuation characters where the punctuation characters are located.

(12) The ejective, ingressive and implosive markers are located at the questioon mark key.

(13) There are three more "r" themed keys above the "r" key, about 14 "r" keys, and that much is necessary.
