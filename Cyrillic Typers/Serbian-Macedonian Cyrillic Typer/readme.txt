Serbian Macedonian Cyrillic Typer;

"Serbian Macedonian Cyrillic Typer" is an installable keyboard layout that aims to type Serbian and Macedonian in one keyboard layout.
It does not have support for other Slavic languages written with the Cyrillic alphabet such as Russian, Belarusian, Ukrainian, and Bulgarian.
It also does not support central Asian languages written in Cyrillic such as Kazakh and Mongolian.

This keyboard layout is based on the QWERTY layout and most of the letters are where you expect them to be.

For example, hitting (L) will give you (Л).
Hitting (D) gives (Д).
Bear in mind that letters are based on the sounds they make, not what they look like.
So, the Cyrillic letter (C) is at (S).

The exemptions to these are:
Hitting (Q) gives (џ | Џ)
Hitting (W) gives (ш | Ш)
Hitting (C) gives (ц | Ц)
Hitting (X) gives (ж | Ж)
Hitting (Y) gives (ѕ | Ѕ)

Hitting (1) gives (ћ | Ћ)
Hitting (2) gives (ђ | Ђ)
Hitting (3) gives (љ | Љ)
Hitting (4) gives (њ | Њ)
Hitting (5) gives (ч | Ч)
Hitting (6) gives (џ | Џ)

Hitting (7) gives (ѓ | Ѓ)
Hitting (8) gives (ќ | Ќ)
Hitting (9) gives (ѐ | Ѐ)
Hitting (0) gives (ѝ | Ѝ)

Hitting (E) while holding AltGr gives (ѐ | Ѐ)
Hitting (G) while holding AltGr gives (ѓ | Ѓ)
Hitting (H) while holding AltGr gives (һ | Һ)
Hitting (I) while holding AltGr gives (ѝ | Ѝ)
Hitting (K) while holding AltGr gives (ќ | Ќ)
Hitting (L) while holding AltGr gives (љ | Љ)
Hitting (N) while holding AltGr gives (њ | Њ)

Hitting (2) while holding AltGr gives (@)
Hitting (3) while holding AltGr gives (#)
Hitting (4) while holding AltGr gives ($)
Hitting (5) while holding AltGr gives (%)
Hitting (6) while holding AltGr gives (^)
Hitting (7) while holding AltGr gives (&)
Hitting (8) while holding AltGr gives (*)
Hitting (9) while holding AltGr gives [(]
Hitting (0) while holding AltGr gives [)]

Capitalisation is done as normal with CapsLock and Shift.

The letter (һ|Һ) is not a part of the Serbian Cyrillic alphabet.
However, it represents an important sound that is otherwise not covered by this alphabet, represented by the letter (h|H) in the Latin alphabet.

The numbers are typed from the numpad. The top row number keys are assigned to Cyrillic letters.
	The numbers can also be typed by pressing ctrl + shift + top row number keys.
The symbols on the top row number keys !@#$%^&*()= can be typed by pressing the AltGr + 1234567890 keys.

The hyphen is typed by pressing the ( \ ) key located under the backspace key.
The parentheses can be typed with the last two keys next to the hyphen key.
The non-breaking hyphen is typed by pressing shift + ( \ ) key located under the backspace key.
The dash key is typed by pressing Ctrl + ( \ ) key located under the backspace key.

The acute accent, which can be combined with vowels to mark stress is typed by pressing control+space.
