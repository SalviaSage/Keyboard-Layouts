This letter is the correct way to write the [h] sound in Cyrillic.

The number keys can only be typed from the numpad because the top row number keys are assigned to extra Cyrillic letters.
The symbols on the top row number keys !@#$%^&* can still be typed by pressing the shift+capslock+12345678 keys.
The hyphen is typed by pressing the ( \ ) key located under the backspace key.
The parentheses can be typed with the last two keys next to the new hyphen key.

Bear in mind that letters are based on the sounds they make, not what they look like. So, the Cyrillic letter (C) is at (S).

Capitalisation is done as normal. Caps lock and shift both work.

There are many variants of the letter (i) all concentrated around the (и) letter.

Please look at the screenshot provided to see where all the keys are.
