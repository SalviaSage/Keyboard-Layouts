Central Asian Cyrillic Typer:

Central Asian Cyrillic Typer is a version of the Slavic Cyrillic Typer layout which aims to write the Kazakh language and other central asian languages in the Cyrillic alpabet.
Even though the Kazakh language is now officially being written with the Latin alphabet and "Latinization" is in progress.

This keyboard layout is based on the QWERTY layout and most of the letters are where you expect them to be.
So you shouldn't have difficulty typing from muscle memory.

For example, hitting 'L' will give you 'Л'. Hitting 'D' will give you 'Д'.

The exemptions to these are:
Hitting 'W' will give you 'Ш'.
Hitting 'C' will give you 'Ч'.

If you want to type the capital letters, you will have to hit the caps lock key. The shift key will never give you any capital letters.
It will give you extra letters or same letters instead.

Also, the acute accent, which can be combined with vowels, to mark stress is where the ' - ' key is on the numpad.
The combining umlaut (diaeresis) which can be combined with certain letters is where the ' / ' key is on the numpad.
The combining inverted breve which can be combined with certain letters is where the ' * ' key is on the numpad.
The combining macron which can be combined with certain letters is where the ' + ' key is on the numpad.

This helps us type some additional letters used in some orthographies.

Russian style quotation marks are where the quotation mark and semicolon keys are.
Russian style "fir tree" quotation marks are where the less than and greater than sign keys are.
They are accessed by holding down the shift + caps lock keys.

Letters unique to cyrillic like ya, yo, ye, yu are where the vowel letters like a, o, e, u are located.
They are accessed by hitting shift + vowel keys.

Please look at the screenshot provided to see where all the keys are.

Also, if you want to type in the Latin alphabet, hit the scroll lock key to switch between Latin and Cyrillic.

It doesn't have all of the "non-slavic" variations of the cyrillic lettersb because there are too many,
but I tried to include all the common central Asian and Turkic letters.

Subject to change.
