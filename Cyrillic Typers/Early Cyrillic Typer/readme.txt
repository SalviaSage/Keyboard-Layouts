Most of the letters are where you would expect them to be.
For example, hitting (L) will give you (Л). Hitting (D) gives (Д).

A list of exemptions:
Hitting (Q) gives (ҁ | Ҁ)
Hitting (W) gives (ш | Ш) while holding RightAlt gives (щ | Щ)
Hitting (C) gives (ц | Ц) while holding RightAlt gives (ꙡ | Ꙡ)
Hitting (X) gives (ж | Ж)
Hitting (Y) gives (ѵ | Ѵ)

Hitting (6) gives (ґ | Ґ)
Hitting (7) gives (є | Є)
Hitting (8) gives (і | І)
Hitting (9) gives (ї | Ї)
Hitting (0) gives (ў | Ў)

The number keys can only be typed from the numpad because the top row number keys are assigned to extra Cyrillic letters. The symbols on the top row number keys !@#$%^&*()= can still be typed by pressing the shift+capslock+1234567890 keys. The parentheses can be typed with the last two keys next to the backspace key. The hyphen is typed by pressing the ( \ ) key located under the backspace key. The (^) is replaced with (₽) for writing the Russian currency.

Bear in mind that letters are based on the sounds they make, not what they look like. So, the Cyrillic letter (C) is at (S).

Capitalisation is done as normal. Caps lock and shift both work.

There are many variants of the letter (i) all concentrated around the (и) letter.

Please look at the screenshot provided to see where all the keys are.

How to type in the Early Cyrillic alphabet?
We use this program as a base and run the Hotstrings.exe application. From there, we load the "IME Cyrillic (Early Cyrillic).csv" library.
Then, we type the related letters and press the (Tab) key to get a menu from where we can pick the related key that we are interested in.
For example, first type the (ь) key, then press the (Tab) key on the keyboard and pick (ѣ) from the menu that appears.

How to type the diacritics that are used in the Early Cyrillic alphabet?
Launch the program "Typer Helper" and pick "Old Church Slavonic" from the drop-down menu. This library has some support for typing the diacritics that are found in early Cyrillic. All of the diacritics are based on the top row number keys. To type the diacritics in order, the number key has to be tapped and held, tap one more time to type the next diacritic in order.

The conjoining titlo has to be used with the zero-width space, for which this program already accounts. Otherwise, it does not work correctly.

The "pokrytie" is the appropriate diacritic to be used for the combining superscript covering which can be seen in some original manuscripts written in early Slavonic. However, when this is attempted on the computer, it does not work and breaks the base letters.
