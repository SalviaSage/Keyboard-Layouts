Based on the Microsoft Russian Mnemonic Keyboard.

"Russian Cyrillic Typer" is an installable keyboard layout that aims to type Russian, Ukrainian, and Belarussian in one keyboard layout.
It has some support for other Slavic languages written with the Cyrillic alphabet such as Serbian Cyrillic and Macedonian Cyrillic.
It does not support Central Asian languages written in Cyrillic such as Kazakh, and Mongolian.
It does not contain the extra letters used in those alphabets.

Other languages written in Cyrillic can be typed using the "IME Cyrillic (Early Cyrillic).csv" library for the Hotstrings.exe program.
Extra combining diacritics for Cyrillic can also be typed using the program "Typer Helper" and selecting "Old Church Slavonic" in the menu.
My approach to having good Cyrillic coverage is with this keyboard layout program, plus the Cyrillic Input Method Editors (IME) and typer helpers.

Most of the letters are where you would expect them to be.
For example, hitting (L) will give you (Л).
Hitting (D) gives (Д).
Bear in mind that letters are based on the sounds they make, not what they look like.
So, the Cyrillic letter (C) is at (S).

A list of exemptions:
Hitting (Q) gives (я | Я)
Hitting (W) gives (ш | Ш)
Hitting (C) gives (ц | Ц)
Hitting (X) gives (ж | Ж)
Hitting (Y) gives (ы | Ы)
Hitting (1) gives (ю | Ю)
Hitting (2) gives (щ | Щ)
Hitting (3) gives (э | Э)
Hitting (4) gives (ё | Ё)
Hitting (5) gives (ч | Ч)
Hitting (6) gives (ґ | Ґ)
Hitting (7) gives (є | Є)
Hitting (8) gives (і | І)
Hitting (9) gives (ї | Ї)
Hitting (0) gives (ў | Ў)

The top row has some of the letters used in Russian, Belarusian, and Ukrainian which is missing on the Microsoft Russian Mnemonic Keyboard.

Capitalisation is done as normal with CapsLock and Shift.

The numbers are typed from the numpad. The top row number keys are assigned to Cyrillic letters.
	The numbers can also be typed by pressing ctrl + shift + top row number keys.
The symbols on the top row number keys !@#$%^&*()= can be typed by pressing the ScrollLock (Kana) + 1234567890 keys.

The hyphen is typed by pressing the ( \ ) key located under the backspace key.
The parentheses can be typed with the last two keys next to the hyphen key.
The non-breaking hyphen is typed by pressing shift + ( \ ) key located under the backspace key.
The dash key is typed by pressing Ctrl + ( \ ) key located under the backspace key.

The currency symbol ($) can be typed with Ctrl + Shift + W.
The currency symbol (¢) can be typed with Ctrl + Shift + Q.
The currency symbol (€) can be typed with Ctrl + Shift + E.
The currency symbol (₽) can be typed with Ctrl + Shift + R.
The currency symbol (₴) can be typed with Ctrl + Shift + G.
The currency symbol (₸) can be typed with Ctrl + Shift + T.
The currency symbol (⃀) can be typed with Ctrl + Shift + S.

The palochka (ӏ) is typed with AltGr + P key.
It is used in the spelling of some Caucasian languages.

The acute accent, which can be combined with vowels to mark stress is typed by pressing control + space.
The grave accent can be typed by pressing control + alt + shift + space.
The diaeresis, especially used on the letter "e" can be typed by pressing ctrl + shift + spacebar.

There are also many variants of the letter (i) all concentrated around the (и) letter.

NOTES ON TYPING OLD CHURCH SLAVONIC AND DIACRITICS:

How to type the diacritics that are used in the Early Cyrillic alphabet?
Launch the program "Typer Helper" and pick "Old Church Slavonic" from the drop-down menu.
This library has some support for typing the diacritics that are found in early Cyrillic.
All of the diacritics are based on the top row number keys.
To type the diacritics in order, the number key has to be tapped and held, tap one more time to type the next diacritic in order.

The conjoining titlo has to be used with the zero-width space, for which this program already accounts.
Otherwise, it does not work correctly.

The "pokrytie" is the appropriate diacritic to be used for the combining superscript covering which can be seen in some original manuscripts written in early Slavonic. However, when this is attempted on the computer, it does not work and breaks the base letters.
