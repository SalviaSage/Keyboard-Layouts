Russian Cyrillic Typer;
Based on the Microsoft Russian Mnemonic Keyboard.

"Russian Cyrillic Typer" is an installable keyboard layout that aims to type Russian, Ukrainian, and Belarussian in one keyboard layout.
It does not have support for other Slavic languages written with the Cyrillic alphabet such as Serbian and Macedonian. It also does not support Central Asian languages written in Cyrillic such as Kazakh and Mongolian.

However, other languages written in Cyrillic can be typed using the "IME Cyrillic (Early Cyrillic).csv" with the Hotstrings.exe program, running alongside this keyboard layout. Extra combining diacritics for Cyrillic can also be typed using the program "Typer Helper" and selecting "Old Church Slavonic" in the menu. My approach to having good Cyrillic coverage is with this keyboard layout program, plus the Cyrillic Input Method Editors (IME) and typer helpers.

This keyboard layout is based on the Russian Mnemonic Keyboard by Microsoft.

Most of the letters are where you would expect them to be.
For example, hitting (L) will give you (Л). Hitting (D) gives (Д).

A list of exemptions:
Hitting (Q) gives (я | Я)
Hitting (W) gives (ш | Ш)
Hitting (C) gives (ц | Ц)
Hitting (X) gives (ж | Ж)
Hitting (Y) gives (ы | Ы)
Hitting (1) gives (ю | Ю)
Hitting (2) gives (щ | Щ)
Hitting (3) gives (э | Э)
Hitting (4) gives (ё | Ё)
Hitting (5) gives (ч | Ч)
Hitting (6) gives (ґ | Ґ)
Hitting (7) gives (є | Є)
Hitting (8) gives (і | І)
Hitting (9) gives (ї | Ї)
Hitting (0) gives (ў | Ў)

The number keys can only be typed from the numpad because the top row number keys are assigned to extra Cyrillic letters. The symbols on the top row number keys !@#$%^&*()= can still be typed by pressing the shift+capslock+1234567890 keys. The parentheses can be typed with the last two keys next to the backspace key. The hyphen is typed by pressing the ( \ ) key located under the backspace key. The ($) is replaced with (₽) in this keyboard layout and the (^) is replaced with (₴) for writing Russian and Ukrainian currencies.

Bear in mind that letters are based on the sounds they make, not what they look like. So, the Cyrillic letter (C) is at (S).

Capitalisation is done as normal. Caps lock and shift both work.

The acute accent, which can be combined with vowels to mark stress is typed by pressing control+space. The grave accent can be typed by pressing control+alt+shift+space.
The diaeresis, especially used on the letter "e" can be typed by pressing ctrl+shift+spacebar.

There are also many variants of the letter (i) all concentrated around the (и) letter.

Please look at the screenshot provided to see where all the keys are.

Types:

Bulgarian

The extra letters used in Ukrainian and Belarussian spelling are found on the 7,8,9,0,= keys on the keyboard.

How to type in the Early Cyrillic alphabet?
We use this program as a base and run the Hotstrings.exe application. From there, we load the "IME Cyrillic (Early Cyrillic).csv" library.
Then, we type the related letters and press the (Tab) key to get a menu from where we can pick the related key that we are interested in.
For example, first type the (ь) key, then press the (Tab) key on the keyboard and pick (ѣ) from the menu that appears.

How to type the diacritics that are used in the Early Cyrillic alphabet?
Launch the program "Typer Helper" and pick "Old Church Slavonic" from the drop-down menu. This library has some support for typing the diacritics that are found in early Cyrillic. All of the diacritics are based on the top row number keys. To type the diacritics in order, the number key has to be tapped and held, tap one more time to type the next diacritic in order.

The conjoining titlo has to be used with the zero-width space, for which this program already accounts. Otherwise, it does not work correctly.

The "pokrytie" is the appropriate diacritic to be used for the combining superscript covering which can be seen in some original manuscripts written in early Slavonic. However, when this is attempted on the computer, it does not work and breaks the base letters.
