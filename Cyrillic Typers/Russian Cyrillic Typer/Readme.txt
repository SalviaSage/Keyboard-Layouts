Russian Cyrillic Typer:

Based on the Microsoft Russian Mnemonic Keyboard.

"Russian Cyrillic Typer" is an installable keyboard layout which aims to type Russian, Ukrainian and Belarussian in one keyboard layout.
It does not have support for other slavic languages written with the Cyrillic alphabet such as Serbian and Macedonian.
It also does not support Central Asian languages written with Cyrillic such as Kazakh and Mongolian.

However, other languages written with Cyrillic can be typed using the Cyrillic IME (Hotstrings.exe) alongside this keyboard layout.
Extra combining diacritics for Cyrillic can also be typed using the program "Typer Helper" and selecting "Cyrillic" and "Early Cyrillic" in the menu.
This is my approach to having good cyrillic coverage, this keyboard plus the use of the Cyrillic IME.

This keyboard layout is based on the QWERTY layout and most of the letters are where you expect them to be.
So you shouldn't have difficulty typing from muscle memory.

For example, hitting 'L' will give you 'Л'. Hitting 'D' will give you 'Д'.

The exemptions to these are:
Hitting 'Q' will give you 'Я'
Hitting 'W' will give you 'Ш'
Hitting 'C' will give you 'Ц'
Hitting 'X' will give you 'Ж'
Hitting 'Y' will give you 'Ы'

However, the number keys can only be typed from the numpad because I assigned those keys to extra cyrillic letters.
The symbols located on the number keys !@#$%^&*()= are typed by pressing shift+capslock+number keys.
The tilde and the underscore is typed the same by pressing the '-' key.
The ($) is replaced with (₽) in this keyboard layout and the (^) is replaced with (₴) for writing Russian and Ukrainian currencies.

Keep in mind that the letters are based on the sounds they make and not what they look like.
So, 'C' is where 'S' is and so on.

Capitalisation is done as normal. Caps lock and shift both work.

The acute accent, which can be combined with vowels to mark stress is typed by pressing shift+spacebar.
The grave accent can be typed by pressing control+spacebar.

There are also many variants of the letter 'i' all concentrated around the 'и' key.

Please look at the screenshot provided to see where all the keys are.

Writes:	Russian
	Belarussian
	Ukrainian
	Bulgarian

The extra letters used in Ukrainian and Belarussian spelling are found on the 7,8,9,0,= keys on the keyboard.

Also, if you want to type in the Latin alphabet, hit the scroll lock key to switch between Latin and Cyrillic.
This restores the default US keyboard and allows us to easily switch back and forth.


How to type in the Early Cyrillic alphabet?
Basically, we use this program as a base and run the Hotstrings.exe application.
From there, we load the IME Cyrillic (Early Cyrillic) library and set the trigger-key to the 'Tab' key.
Then, we type the related letters and press the 'Tab' key to get a menu from where we can pick the related key that we are interested.
For example, first type the 'ь key, then press the 'Tab' key on the keyboard and pick 'ѣ' from the menu that appears.

How to type the diacritics that are used in the Early Cyrillic alphabet?
Same as the above instructions, and then launch the program "Typer Helper" and pick "Early Cyrillic" from the drop down menu.
All of the diacritics are based on the number keys.
To type the diacritics in order, the number key has to be tapped and held, tap one more time to type the next diacritic in order.

The conjoining titlo has to be used with the zero-width space which this program already accounts for.
Otherwise it does not work correctly.

The 'pokrytie' is the appropriate diacritic to be used for doing the combining superscript covering which can be seen in some original manuscripts written in early Slavonic.
However, when this is attempted on the computer it simply does not work and breaks the base letters as well.
I don't know when or how this particular issue can be fixed.
