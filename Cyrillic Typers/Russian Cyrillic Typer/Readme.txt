Russian Cyrillic Typer;

This is a version of the cyrillic slavic keyboard layout modified for writing only Russian.
It contains all 33 of the cyrillic letters used to write Russian plus the letter (һ,Һ) which isn't a part of the Russian alphabet.
However, this key was empty and there is no way to write the sound [h] exactly in Russian, so I placed that letter there.
Use it at your own discretion.

Caps lock must be used for writing capital letters as shift only gives us variant or related letters instead.
This is because the Latin alphabet has 26 letters while the Russian Cyrillic alphabet has 33 letters and they don't fit into the keyboard.
