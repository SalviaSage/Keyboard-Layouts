Serbian Cyrillic Typer;

"Serbian Cyrillic Typer" is an installable keyboard layout that aims to type Serbian and Macedonian in one keyboard layout. It does not have support for other Slavic languages written with the Cyrillic alphabet such as Russian and Ukrainian. It also does not support central Asian languages written in Cyrillic such as Kazakh and Mongolian.

This keyboard layout is based on the QWERTY layout and most of the letters are where you expect them to be.

For example, hitting (L) will give you (Л). Hitting (D) gives (Д).

The exemptions to these are:
Hitting (Q) gives (џ | Џ)
Hitting (W) gives (ш | Ш)
Hitting (C) gives (ц | Ц)
Hitting (X) gives (ж | Ж)
Hitting (Y) gives (ѕ | Ѕ)
Hitting (1) gives (ч | Ч)
Hitting (2) gives (ћ | Ћ)
Hitting (3) gives (ђ | Ђ)
Hitting (4) gives (љ | Љ)
Hitting (5) gives (њ | Њ)
Hitting (6) gives (ѓ | Ѓ)
Hitting (7) gives (ќ | Ќ)
Hitting (8) gives (ѝ | Ѝ)
Hitting (9) gives (ѐ | Ѐ)
Hitting (0) gives (һ | Һ)

This last letter, (һ | Һ) is not officially a part of the Serbian Cyrillic alphabet, however, it represents an important sound that is otherwise not covered by this alphabet.

The number keys can only be typed from the numpad because the top row number keys are assigned to extra Cyrillic letters. The symbols on the top row number keys !@#$%^&*()= can still be typed by pressing the shift+capslock+1234567890 keys. The parentheses can be typed with the last two keys next to the backspace key. The hyphen is typed by pressing the ( \ ) key located under the backspace key.

Bear in mind that letters are based on the sounds they make, not what they look like. So, the Cyrillic letter (C) is at (S).

Capitalisation is done as normal. Caps lock and shift both work.

The acute accent, which can be combined with vowels to mark stress is typed by pressing control+space. The grave accent can be typed by pressing control+shift+space.
