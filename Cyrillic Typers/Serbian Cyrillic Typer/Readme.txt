Serbian Cyrillic Typer:

"Serbian Cyrillic Typer" is an installable keyboard layout which aims to type Serbian and Macedonian in one keyboard layout.
It does not have support for other slavic languages written with the Cyrillic alphabet such as Russian and Ukrainian.
It also does not support central asian languages written with Cyrillic such as Kazakh and Mongolian.

However, other languages written with Cyrillic can be typed using the Cyrillic IME (Hotstrings.exe) alongside this keyboard layout.
Extra combining diacritics for Cyrillic can also be typed using the program "Typer Helper" and selecting "Cyrillic" in the menu.
This is my approach to having good cyrillic coverage, this keyboard plus the use of the Cyrillic IME.

This keyboard layout is based on the QWERTY layout and most of the letters are where you expect them to be.
So you shouldn't have difficulty typing from muscle memory.

For example, hitting 'L' will give you 'Л'. Hitting 'D' will give you 'Д'.

The exemptions to these are:
Hitting 'Q' will give you 'џ | Џ'
Hitting 'W' will give you 'ш | Ш'
Hitting 'C' will give you 'ц | Ц'
Hitting 'X' will give you 'ж | Ж'
Hitting 'Y' will give you 'ѕ | Ѕ'
Hitting '1' will give you 'ч | Ч'
Hitting '2' will give you 'ћ | Ћ'
Hitting '3' will give you 'ђ | Ђ'
Hitting '4' will give you 'љ | Љ'
Hitting '5' will give you 'њ | Њ'
Hitting '6' will give you 'ѓ | Ѓ'
Hitting '7' will give you 'ќ | Ќ'
Hitting '8' will give you 'ѝ | Ѝ'
Hitting '9' will give you 'ѐ | Ѐ'
Hitting '0' will give you 'һ | Һ'

However, the number keys can only be typed from the numpad because I assigned those keys to extra cyrillic letters.
The symbols located on the number keys are typed by pressing shift+capslock+number keys such as !@#$%^&*()

Keep in mind that the letters are based on the sounds they make and not what they look like.
So, 'C' is where 'S' is and so on.

Capitalisation is done as normal. Caps lock and shift both work.

The acute accent is typed by pressing control+spacebar.
The grave accent can be typed by pressing control+shift+spacebar.

Please look at the screenshot provided to see where all the keys are.

Also, if you want to type in the Latin alphabet, hit the scroll lock key to switch between Latin and Cyrillic.
This restores the default US keyboard and allows us to easily switch back and forth.
