Slavic Cyrillic Typer:

"Slavic Cyrillic Typer" is an installable keyboard layout which aims to type all Slavic languages written with the Cyrillic alpabet in one keyboard layout.
It does not have support for non-slavic languages written with the Cyrillic alphabet.
Those languages do have some extra letters that are not in this keyboard layout.
There is, however a "Kazakh Cyrillic Typer" that I made which has the additional letters of the Kazakh Cyrillic alphabet.

This keyboard layout is based on the QWERTY layout and most of the letters are where you expect them to be.
So you shouldn't have difficulty typing from muscle memory.

For example, hitting 'L' will give you 'Л'. Hitting 'D' will give you 'Д'.

The exemptions to these are:
Hitting 'W' will give you 'Ш'.
Hitting 'C' will give you 'Ч'.

Hitting 'H' will give you the Serbian Cyrillic letters "Ћ" and hitting "Shift+H" will give you 'Ђ'.
If you want to type an actual "h" even though it is not a letter in any slavic language, you can still do so by pressing the shift+x key.
The closest sound that comes to that is the cyrillic letter "х". Even though, "h" is a common letter and a sound in many languages, it just isn't there in Slavic spelling.

Hitting 'Q' will give you the soft sign 'ь' and hitting "Shift+H" will give you the hard sign "ъ'.

Keep in mind that the letters are based on the sounds they make and not what they look like.
So, 'C' is where 'S' is and so on. The letter 'Ч' is where the letter 'C' is.

If you want to type the capital letters, you will have to hit the caps lock key.
The shift key will never give you any capital letters.
It will give you extra letters or same small letters instead.

Also, the acute accent, which can be combined with vowels, to mark stress is where the ' / ' key is on the numpad.
If you want to type the grave accent, just hit shift+/

The combining umlaut (diaeresis) which can be combined with certain letters is where the ' + ' key is on the numpad.
The combining breve and inverted breve which can be combined with certain letters is where the ' * ' key is on the numpad.
The combining macron which can be combined with certain letters is where the ' - ' key is on the numpad.

This helps us type some additional letters used in some Slavic orthographies.

The Ruble sign is located where the Dollar sign is, digit four, on the keyboard.
The "Hryvnia" sign (currency of Ukraine) is where the digit five is on the keyboard.
The Euro Sign is typed the same way with caps lock + shift+4.

Russian style quotation marks are where the quotation mark and semicolon keys are.
Russian style "fir tree" quotation marks are where the less than and greater than sign keys are.
They are accessed by holding down the shift + caps lock keys.

Also, the apostrophe is where the comma key is, accessed by hitting caps lock + comma key.
It is the correct way of writing apostrophes.

Letters unique to cyrillic like ya, yo, ye, yu are where the vowel letters like a, o, e, u are located.
They are accessed by hitting shift + vowel keys.

There are also many variants of the letter 'i' all concentrated around the 'i' key.

Please look at the screenshot provided to see where all the keys are.
