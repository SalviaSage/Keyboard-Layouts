Bengali typer, modeled after the Devanagari typer.

There are some differences between the two keyboards.

Please see the layout screenshot.

Also, it only has 2 conjunct consonants on the numpad.
There are probably more. So, the numpad is still operational.

  Unfortunately, this layout is so much more buggy as compared with the Devanagari typer.
  It has a bug with the maatras not joining properly.
  I don't even think it is usable as of now, until those bugs are fixed.
