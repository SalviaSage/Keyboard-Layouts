Japanese Kana Typer Version History;

	1.0 (May 20, 2024)
Upload and release of the first version of Japanese Typer.
It does work but there may be some integration and recognition issues from Windows.

	1.1 (May 26, 2024)
It's pretty buggy after the compilation of the first release.

1) The switch to the Latin alphabet with the scroll lock sends double letters instead of single letters due to deadkey assignments.
For this reason, the switch to typing in the Latin alphabet with the scroll lock is disabled in Hiragana and Katakana typers.
On the dual version, it switches between Hiragana and Katakana.

2) If the Hotstrings program is running, on the dual version, the Katakana does not work and sends Latin alphabet letters instead.
I don't know why there is such a problem, but it is this program that enables the use of Kanji.
Therefore, using the dual version is not recommended at this time.

3) It also says "Unavailable Input Method" When we install the program alongside Microsoft IME for Japanese.
For this reason, I compiled the programs under the "English" locale instead of the preferred "Japanese" locale.
That may still have problems but it is one feasible work-around right now.
