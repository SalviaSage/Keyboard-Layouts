Coptic-Old Nubian Typer;
A computer program that lets you type in the Coptic Alphabet.

This alphabet is a variant of the Greek alphabet, however it has its own Unicode section.
The base keys are exactly the same as the 'Greek Typer Layout' but pressing shift + keys give us some extra keys.

The 'Shift' key does not give you capital letters.
Instead, it gives you extra letters of the Coptic alphabet.
Usually, these are related in sound to the base keys.

To type the capital letters you must press the Caps Lock key.

It may be that this text is not supported or looks wrong.
Using certain fonts specifically made for Coptic will alleviate this problem.

Coptic does not have its own language designation in Windows, so it is saved under the Greek language.
It is however, a separate language and relates to the historical language of Egypt.
