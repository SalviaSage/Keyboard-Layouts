Coptic Typer;
A computer program that lets you type in the Coptic Alphabet.

This alphabet is a variant of the Greek alphabet, however it has its own Unicode section.
The base keys are exactly the same as the 'Greek Typer Layout' but pressing the number keys give us some extra keys.

It may be that this text is not supported or looks wrong.
Using certain fonts specifically made for Coptic will alleviate this problem.

Coptic does not have its own language designation in Windows, so it is saved under 'custom'.
