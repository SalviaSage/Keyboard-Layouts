It seems that Asomtavruli are only capital letters while Nuskhuri is only small case letters
Mkhedruli has both capital and small case forms. This script also seems to be the most popular and the most modern one.
So, the base keys are Mkhedruli and caps lock + base keys are Mkhedruli capital lettes.

Shift+base keys are variant letters or ejective letters.

Nuskhuri letters are located in the Goergian Supplement block while Asomtavruli is located in the same block as Mkhedruli.
Asomtavruli is the capital case forms of the Nuskhuri letters.

I decided it would be best to create two separate alphabets and did so.
To type in Nuskhuri and Asomtavruli, also install the other program.
