This layout lets you type capital letters at the size of smallcase letters such as:

A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z
ᴀ ʙ ᴄ ᴅ ᴇ ꜰ ɢ ʜ ɪ ᴊ ᴋ ʟ ᴍ ɴ ᴏ ᴘ ꞯ ʀ ꜱ ᴛ ᴜ ᴠ ᴡ x ʏ ᴢ

Out of these, only "Q" is problematic and does not seem to work.
I can't fix this from my end.

And so, in this new version, which I call the alternate version,
I got around the problem of the "Q" letter not working, by using the small cap o + the combining grave accent below
character, U+0316.

A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z
ᴀ ʙ ᴄ ᴅ ᴇ ꜰ ɢ ʜ ɪ ᴊ ᴋ ʟ ᴍ ɴ ᴏ ᴘ ᴏ̖ ʀ ꜱ ᴛ ᴜ ᴠ ᴡ x ʏ ᴢ

I set the keyboard layout so both of those characters get sent when we press the letter "Q".
It does look good enough for legibility purposes. Although, the way it should look is that the grave accent would actually be halfway in the letter, which we can't do.

Also of note is that the small cap "X" does not exist in Unicode. So I substituted the smallcase "x" there instead. It looks exactly the way it would look anyway. So, I think we got away there... we now have an almost perfect system of typing the small caps, except for that little issue with the letter "Q" that I mentioned above.

So, what use is this? Well, it can be useful for typesetting, and give you an extra way of typing things aside from the italics and the bold letters. Also, it is really good to use with Latin language texts, since historically, the Latin language did not have small case letters anyway.
