Lets you tpye Capital letters at the size of smallcase letters such as:

A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z
ᴀ ʙ ᴄ ᴅ ᴇ ꜰ ɢ ʜ ɪ ᴊ ᴋ ʟ ᴍ ɴ ᴏ ᴘ ꞯ ʀ ꜱ ᴛ ᴜ ᴠ ᴡ x ʏ ᴢ

Out of these, only "Q" is problematic and does not seem to work.
I can't fix this from my end but maybe they will at a later date.
