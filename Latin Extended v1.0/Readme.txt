The idea behind the Latin extended keyboard layout is;
being able to type many different languages written with the Latin alphabet and correctly account for all the diacritics
and the additional letters that are there.

English does not make use of any combining diacritics in its orthography, but other languages do.
I decided to create this alphabet as a one master alphabet solution to my frustration of not being able to type other languages written with the
Latin alphabet.

1) The numpads keys are entirely changed to house the combining diacritics.

2) Also, the "tilde, backtick" key, left of the key "one" houses the letters thorn and eth.
This helps us write Old English and Icelandic better.

3) The "Okina" from the Hawaiian alphabet is where the apostrophe key is, accessed by hitting caps lock+ apostrophe.
The "Okina" is correctly encoded in Unicode as: "modifier letter turned comma (U+02BB)"

It's opposite is also in the keyboard layout as: "modifier letter apostrophe (U+02BC);
accessed by hitting shift+caps lock key and then the apostrophe key.

"prime (U+2032)" is also located there, accessed by hitting the ctrl + apoostrophe key.

It doesn't have some of the letters that may be used in African languages, but I think it can type almost everything else outside of that.
