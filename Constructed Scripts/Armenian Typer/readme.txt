Armenian Typer;
This keyboard layout lets you type the Armenian Alphabet.
I tried to keep the letters in alignment with where the letters are on the QWERTY layout, but the letter (q) was not there, so it was assigned to another letter. Using the caps lock button is the only way to type capital letters. Pressing shift gives us extra and variant letters. These letters are supposed to relate to the base letters. For some, there are no alternative letters, in which case, pressing shift+key gives nothing.

Capital letters are only typed by using the Caps Lock key, not the shift key.

Top row number key houses additional letters.
For some letters, there are shift variants of the letters, these are phonetically related to the base letters.

The Armenian currency sign, the Dram sign can be typed by pressing shift+6.

You can switch between certain Armenian punctuation marks and Latin punctuation marks by pressing Scroll Lock.
