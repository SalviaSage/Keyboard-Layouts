NKo Typer;
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N%27Ko_script

This is a constructed script that has some similarities with the Arabic script. It is intended to write some African languages. Its direction is right to left, the same as Arabic. This typing program incorporates some Arabic punctuation marks such as the Arabic question mark, Arabic comma, Arabic full stop etc. To type the non-Arabic variants of these right-to-left punctuation marks, press shift+key.

Similar to Arabic, the alphabet features a low line running across the words and the letters are joined together. To type an empty connector line, like the Arabic tatweel character, type shift+hyphen key on the keyboard.

There is no letter (q), therefore, I put one extra punctuation mark unique to NKo at that position.

There is a full row of combining diacritics on the top row from 1 to 0.

By default, the numbers are typed from the numpad as ߀߁߂߃߄߅߆߇߈߉.
Press the scroll lock key to switch between typing as 0123456789.

NKo numerals use positional notation.
Unlike both Western and Eastern Arabic numerals, digits decrease in significance from right to left. That is, the direction of the digits is also correctly right to left. This is in contrast with Arabic and other systems. So for example, after 9, it becomes 01 instead of 10.

"A curious feature of numeric notation in right-to-left scripts is that the order of digits is almost always the same as in left-to-right running scripts, i.e., the least-significant digits are placed to the right. The only known exception is found in the Nko alphabet, where the direction of writing is also transferred onto the direction of number representation, with the least significant digit placed to the left, thus the highest one is written first:"
