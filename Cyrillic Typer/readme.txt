"Cyrillic Typer" is an installable keyboard layout which aims to type all Slavic languages written with the Cyrillic alpabet in one keyboard layout.
However, it does not have support for non-slavic languages written with the Cyrillic alphabet. Those do have some extra letters that are not in this keyboard layout.

So, with this keyboard layout, we should be able to type in Cyrillic and it is based on the QWERTY layout.
So, the letters are exactly where their QWERTY equivalenmts would be in the keyboard.
For example, hitting "L" will give you "Л". The Caps lock works as normal.

And, if you hit shift+letter, you get additional letters.

Keep in mind that the letters are based on the sounds they make and not what they look like.
So, "C" is where "S" is and so on.

The "q" key has the soft sign letter and the shift+"q" key has the hard sign letter.

The letter "э" is where the letter "a" is located, accessed by hitting shift + a.

Letters "Tse" and "Dzhe" are where the letter "h" is.
Technically, cyrillic doesn't have the letter "h" or its sound, so its space was filled with "tse" and "dzhe" letters.

The letter "Che" is where the button "C" is.

Backwards "R" is of course, accessed by hitting shift + r.

Also, the acute accent, which can be combined with vowels, to mark stress is where the " / " key is on the numpad.
Simply, type the letter, then hit that key, then hit space bar.
This also gives us some additional letters used in some Slavic orthographies.

The "Ukrainian Ie" "є" is located where the "Z" key is.

"Yu" is located where the "y" key is, accessed by pressing shift + y
