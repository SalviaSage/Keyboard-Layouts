Cyrillic typer is an installable keyboard layout which aims to type all Slavic languages written in Cyrillic, in one keyboard layout.
However, it does not have support for languages that are not from the Slavic language family that may be written with the Cyrillic alphabet.

So, with this keyboard layout, we should be able to type in cyrillic and it is based on the QWERTY layout, exactly where the letters are.
For example, hitting "L" will give you "Л". The Caps lock works as normal.

And, if you hit shift+letter, you get additional letters.

Keep in mind that the letters are based on the sounds they make and not what they look like so, "с" is where "s" is and so on.

The "q" key has the soft sign and the hard sign letters.

The letter "э" is where the letter "a" is located, accessed by hitting shift + a.

Letters "Tse" and "Dzhe" are where the letter "x" is.
The cyrillic letter that looks like an "X" is where the "H" is.

The letter "Che" is where the button "C" is.

Backwards "R" is of course, accessed by hitting shift + r.

Also, the acute accent, which can be combined with vowels, to mark stress is where the " / " key is on the numpad.
Simply, type the letter, then hit that key, then hit space bar.
This also gives us some additional letters used in some Slavic orthographies.

The "Ukrainian Ie" "є" is located where the "Z" key is.

"Yu" is located where the "y" key is, accessed by pressing shift + y
