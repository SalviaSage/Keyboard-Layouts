Cyrillic Typer:

"Cyrillic Typer" is an installable keyboard layout which aims to type Russian and Ukrainian in one keyboard layout.
It does not have support for other slavic languages written with the Cyrillic alphabet such as Serbian and Macedonian.
It also does not support central asian languages written with Cyrillic such as Kazakh and Mongolian.

However, other languages written with Cyrillic can be typed using the Cyrillic IME (Hotstrings.exe) alongside this keyboard layout.
Extra combining diacritics for Cyrillic can also be typed using the program "Typer Helper" and selecting "Cyrillic" in the menu.
This is my approach to having good cyrillic coverage, this keyboard plus the use of the Cyrillic IME.

This keyboard layout is based on the QWERTY layout and most of the letters are where you expect them to be.
So you shouldn't have difficulty typing from muscle memory.

For example, hitting 'L' will give you 'Л'. Hitting 'D' will give you 'Д'.

The exemptions to these are:
Hitting 'W' will give you 'Ш'.
Hitting 'C' will give you 'Ч'.

However, the number keys can only be typed from the numpad because I assigned those keys to extra cyrillic letters.
The symbols located on the number keys are typed by pressing shift+capslock+number keys such as !@#$%^&*()
The ($) is replaced with (₽) in this keyboard layout and the (^) is replaced with (₴) for writing Russian and Ukrainian currencies.

Keep in mind that the letters are based on the sounds they make and not what they look like.
So, 'C' is where 'S' is and so on. The letter 'Ч' is where the letter 'C' is.

Capitalisation is done as normal. Caps lock and shift both work.

The acute accent, which can be combined with vowels to mark stress is typed by pressing shift+capslock+backtick.

Russian style quotation marks are where the quotation mark and semicolon keys are.
Russian style "fir tree" quotation marks are where the less than and greater than sign keys are.
They are accessed by holding down the shift + caps lock keys.

There are also many variants of the letter 'i' all concentrated around the 'и' key.

Please look at the screenshot provided to see where all the keys are.

Also, if you want to type in the Latin alphabet, hit the scroll lock key to switch between Latin and Cyrillic.
This restores the default US keyboard and allows us to easily switch back and forth.
