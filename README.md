# Keyboard-Layouts
This repository contains the installable keyboards that I created for Win10.

CTRL+SHIFT: Cycles the keyboard layouts within the same language, does not switch languages.  
WINKEY + SPACE: Cycles all of the keyboard layouts, across languages as well.  
ALT+SHIFT: Cycles languages, not the keyboard layouts.

If you have the "UnicodeInput" program running in the background, then you can type Unicode characters very easily.
ALT + Numpad+ : Enter Unicode "code" and hit enter to type that unicode character.
