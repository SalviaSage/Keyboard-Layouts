# Keyboard-Layouts
This repository contains the installable keyboards that I created for Win10.

**CTRL+SHIFT*:** Cycles the keyboard layouts within the same language, does not switch languages.  
**WINKEY + SPACE:** Cycles all of the keyboard layouts, across languages as well.  
**ALT+SHIFT:** Cycles languages, not the keyboard layouts.

If you have the "UnicodeInput" program running in the background, then you can type Unicode characters very easily.
**ALT + Numpad+ :** Enter Unicode "code" and hit enter to type that unicode character.

How to uninstall / remove keyboard layouts?
Click on the name of the language on the language bar such as "ENG US"
Then, click on "Language Preferences"
There, select the language that that keyboard layout is associated with and click on "Options"
There, you will see a list of keyboards that are available for that language.
Just click on the keyboard layout that you want to remove, then you will get a button that says "Remove."

The keyboard layout should then be deleted immediately and you won't see it anymore in the language bar.

Also, it seems you have to restart the computer to be able to use your installed keyboard layouts.
