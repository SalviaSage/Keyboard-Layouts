QWERTY Greek Alphabet Keyboard Layout;

Most of the letters are exactly where they are.
See the screenshots for further details.

The letter "sigma" has a different letter form when it appears at the end of words.
This is only true for the small letter sigma, not the capital letter.
If you want to type that, press the "c" key on the keyboard.
That's how you are supposed to type words.
For example: "αδελφοσ" is incorrect and "αδελφος" is correct.

The letter (χ) "chi" is where the (x) key is.
The letter (ξ) "ksi" is where the (j) key is.
The letter (ψ) "psi" is where the (v) key is.
The letter (θ) "theta" is where the (u) key is.
The letter (ω) "omega" is where the (w) key is.

This program fully supports the Greek Monotonic and Polytonic orthography.

It includes the two diacritical markings that are used in the monotonic orthography.
The "tonos" (acute accent) is typed by pressing the (Q) key.
	Alternatively, they can be typed by using right alt plus the vowel letter.
The diaeresis which serves to cause the vowels to be pronounced separately (diaeresis) is typed by pressing Shift+Q.
Both the tonos and the diaeresis together can be typed by pressing Ctrl+Shift+Q.

The stand-alone, non-combining forms of these markers can be typed by pressing AltGr+L.

The "Lower Numeral Sign" is used to mark thousands and is supposed to be used BEFORE the letters.
͵Α ͵β ,Γ ͵Δ ͵Ε ͵Ϛ ͵Ζ ͵Η ͵Θ ͵Ι

Another practice is to type the combining overline over letters, which can be typed by AltGr+Numpad0.
