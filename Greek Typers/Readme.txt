QWERTY Greek Alphabet Keyboard Layout:

This keyboard layout is the same as the default English US keyboard layout
except all the letters have been changed from the Latin alphabet to the Greek alphabet.

Most of  the letters are exactly where they are.
See the screenshots for further details.

I intentionally excluded out the historical Greek letters that are no longer used.
However, they can still be typed by using a Hotstrings.exe library.

The letter "sigma" has a different letter form when it appears at the end of words.
This is only true for the small letter sigma, not the capital letter.

If you want to type that, you just have to press the "c" key on the keyboard.
That's how you are supposed to type words.
For example: "αδελφοσ"is incorrect and "αδελφος" is correct.

The letter 'χ' 'chi' is where the 'x' key is.
The letter 'ξ' 'ksi' is where the 'v' key is.
The letter 'ψ' 'psi' is where the 'j' key is.
The letter 'θ' 'theta' is where the 'u' key is.
The letter 'ω' 'omega' is where the 'w' key is.

This program fully supports the Greek Monotonic orthography.
It includes the two diacritical markings that are used in the monotonic orthography.
The 'tonos' (acute accent) is typed by pressing the Q key.
The diaeresis which serves to cause the vowels to be pronounced separately is typed by pressing shift+Q.

Also, you can switch between typing in the Greek alphabet and the
Latin alphabet by hitting the scroll lock key (kana lock key).

The italics version is the same thing as the regular version, except the letters are typed slanted.

In the combined version, the scroll lock does not give us the Latin keys.
Instead it gives us the same greek letters, but in italics, this is also useful for typing math.

In the Lunate Sigma version, we can type the lunate sigma by pressing shift+caps+s and shift+caps+c.
We can also type it in the capital with caps or shift+c on the keyboard.
