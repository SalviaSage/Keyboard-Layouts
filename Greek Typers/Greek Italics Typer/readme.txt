QWERTY Greek Alphabet Italics Keyboard Layout;

Most of the letters are exactly where they are.
See the screenshots for further details.

I intentionally excluded the historical Greek letters that are no longer used. However, they can still be typed by using a Hotstrings.exe library.

The letter "sigma" has a different letter form when it appears at the end of words. This is only true for the small letter sigma, not the capital letter. If you want to type that, press the "c" key on the keyboard. That's how you are supposed to type words. For example: "αδελφοσ" is incorrect and "αδελφος" is correct.

The letter (χ) "chi" is where the (x) key is.
The letter (ξ) "ksi" is where the (j) key is.
The letter (ψ) "psi" is where the (v) key is.
The letter (θ) "theta" is where the (u) key is.
The letter (ω) "omega" is where the (w) key is.

This program fully supports the Greek Monotonic orthography.
It includes the two diacritical markings that are used in the monotonic orthography. The "tonos" (acute accent) is typed by pressing the (Q) key.
The diaeresis which serves to cause the vowels to be pronounced separately is typed by pressing shift+Q.

The italics version is the same as the regular version, except the letters are typed slanted.
