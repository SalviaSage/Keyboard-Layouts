Greek Mathematical Italics Keyboard Layout;

The letter "sigma" has a different letter form when it appears at the end of words. This is only true for the small letter sigma, not the capital letter. If you want to type that, press the "c" key on the keyboard. That's how you are supposed to type words. For example: "αδελφοσ" is incorrect and "αδελφος" is correct.

The letter (χ) "chi" is where the (x) key is.
The letter (ξ) "ksi" is where the (j) key is.
The letter (ψ) "psi" is where the (v) key is.
The letter (θ) "theta" is where the (u) key is.
The letter (ω) "omega" is where the (w) key is.

The italics version is the same as the regular version, except the letters are typed slanted.
