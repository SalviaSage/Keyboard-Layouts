Greek Capitals Typer:

This keyboard layout is the same as the Greek Typer keyboard layout
except all the letters are in capitals and there are additional capital letters where the number letters are.

Most of  the letters are exactly where they are.
See the screenshots for further details.

The letter 'χ' 'chi' is where the 'x' key is.
The letter 'ξ' 'ksi' is where the 'j' key is.
The letter 'ψ' 'psi' is where the 'v' key is.
The letter 'θ' 'theta' is where the 'u' key is.
The letter 'ω' 'omega' is where the 'w' key is.

This program fully supports the Greek Monotonic orthography.

Also, you can switch between typing in the Greek alphabet and the
Latin alphabet by hitting the scroll lock key (kana lock key).

I thought the capital letters may have historical significance so I made this keyboard layout.
