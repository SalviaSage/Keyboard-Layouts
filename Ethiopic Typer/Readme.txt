QWERTY Ethiopic (Ge'ez Script) Keyboard Layout:

Switch between the Ethiopic and the Latin alphabet by pressing the scroll lock key.
There is a perfect letter to letter ratio here because the Ethiopic writing system also has 26 letters.
It has however some variant letters with a bar going on top of the letters.
Those letters are typed by pressing shift+key.
For some letters, there are also capslock and capslock+shift variants.

Does not contain the Ethiopic Extended-B Unicode Range.

The spaced version types a slightly wider space due to the wider width of the letters.

This program itself is not enough to type in Ethiopian languages due to many letter variants.
An IME has to be used. Run the IME program and after typing the letter press the tab key or the trigger key
then select the letter that is desired from the menu that appears.

How to type Ethiopic numbers correctly on the computer?
Typically ethiopic numbers have lines that go on top of the letters and under the letters.
The lines are correctly supposed to connect to each other on top of the numerals and below the numerals continuously.
However, although the top line connects without problems, in certain cases there are graphical glitches for the line below the numbers.
One way around this problem to ensure that it displays correctly is to use the zero width no-break space (U+FEFF).
This however also has the downside of cutting the continous line into segments, but at least the graphical glitch is avoided.

The numerals are located on the top row number keys.
To type the regular numerals, use the numpad.

The program does not include the Ethiopic tonal marks.
